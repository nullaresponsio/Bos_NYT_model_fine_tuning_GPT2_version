{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on P.", "instruction": "Explain Other languages", "response": "In English orthography, ‚ü®p‚ü© represents the sound /p/. A common digraph in English is ‚ü®ph‚ü©, which represents the sound , and can be used to transliterate ‚ü®œÜ‚ü© phi in loanwords from Greek. In German, the digraph ‚ü®pf‚ü© is common, representing a labial affricate /pf/. Most English words beginning with ‚ü®p‚ü© are of foreign origin, primarily French, Latin and Greek; these languages preserve the Proto-Indo-European initial *p. Native English cognates of such words often start with ‚ü®f‚ü©, since English is a Germanic language and thus has undergone Grimm's law; a native English word with an initial /p/ would reflect Proto-Indo-European initial *b, which is so rare that its existence as a phoneme is disputed. However, native English words with non-initial ‚ü®p‚ü© are quite common; such words can come from either Kluge's law or the consonant cluster /sp/ (PIE: *p has been preserved after s). P is the eighth least frequently used letter in the English language. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P)"}
