  "assistant": "The Edwin Smith Papyrus is an ancient Egyptian medical text, named after Edwin Smith who bought it in 1862, and the oldest known surgical treatise on trauma. This document, which may have been a manual of military surgery, describes 48 cases of injuries, fractures, wounds, dislocations and tumors. It dates to Dynasties 16–17 of the Second Intermediate Period in ancient Egypt, c. 1600 BCE.: 70 The papyrus is unique among the four principal medical papyri that survive today. While other papyri, such as the Ebers Papyrus and London Medical Papyrus, are medical texts based in magic, the Edwin Smith Papyrus presents a rational and scientific approach to medicine in ancient Egypt,: 58 in which medicine and magic do not conflict. Magic would be more prevalent had the cases of illness been mysterious, such as internal disease. The Edwin Smith papyrus is a scroll 4.68 meters or 15.3 feet in length. The recto (front side) has 377 lines in 17 columns, while the verso (backside) has 92 lines in five columns. Aside from the fragmentary outer column of the scroll, the remainder of the papyrus is intact, although it was cut into one-column pages some time in the 20th century.: 70 It is written right-to-left in hieratic, the Egyptian cursive form of hieroglyphs, in black ink with explanatory glosses in red ink. The vast majority of the papyrus is concerned with trauma and surgery, with short sections on gynaecology and cosmetics on the verso. On the recto side, there are 48 cases of injury. Each case details the type of the injury, examination of the patient, diagnosis and prognosis, and treatment.: 26–28 The verso side consists of eight magic spells and five prescriptions. The spells of the verso side and two incidents in Case 8 and Case 9 are the exceptions to the practical nature of this medical text.: 70 Generic spells and incantations may have been used as a last resort in terminal cases.\n\nAmenhotep was an ancient Egyptian official and chief physician of the early 19th Dynasty. He is mainly known from his decorated tomb chapel that was excavated in 1913–14 by Ahmed Bey Kamal at Asyut, in Middle Egypt. Amenhotep hold several titles, such as king's scribe, chief lector priest, overseer of wab priests of Sakhmet and chief physician. His wife is depicted in the tomb chapel. She was the song-tress of Wepwawet and song-tress of Amun-Ra Renenutet. His son Yuny is known from a statue found not far away and was also overseer of wab priests of Sakhmet and chief physician. His grandson Khay also held the latter position. The tomb chapel of Amenhotep was once relatively small, perhaps once only three meters long, 1.52 meter wide and 2.40 meter high. The ceiling was vaulted. The walls are decorated with a combination of painted, raised and sunken relief. On the back wall, Amenhotep is shown twice sitting at an offering table. On a second, higher register he is shown twice in front of Osiris. On the right side of the chapel he is again shown in front of Osiris in the judgement scene. On the left wall, Amenhotep and his family are shown guided by Hathor to the sun god Ra and Anubis. The chapel was found well preserved and even substantial remains of the colouring remained. Today the fragments are in different collections. Substantial parts of the back and the right wall are in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, main parts of the left wall are in the Cleveland Museum of Art.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Smith_Papyrus"
