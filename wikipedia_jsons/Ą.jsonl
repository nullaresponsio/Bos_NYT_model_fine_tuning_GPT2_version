{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ą.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "Ą (minuscule: ą) is a letter in the Polish, Kashubian, Lithuanian, Creek, Navajo, Western Apache, Chiricahua, Osage, Hocąk, Mescalero, Gwich'in, Tutchone, and Elfdalian alphabets. It is formed from the letter a and an ogonek (\"little tail\") and usually, except in modern Lithuanian and Polish, denotes a nasal a sound. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%84)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ą.", "instruction": "Explain Pronunciation", "response": "In the Polish alphabet, ą comes after a, but never appears at the beginning of a word. Originally, ą used to represent a nasal a sound, but in modern times, its pronunciation has shifted to a nasal o sound. The letter does not have one determined pronunciation and instead, its pronunciation is dependent on the sounds that follow it. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%84)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ą.", "instruction": "Explain Alternations", "response": "Polish ą sound evolved from a long nasal a sound of medieval Polish into a short nasal o sound in the modern language. The medieval vowel, along with its short counterpart, evolved in turn from the merged nasal *ę and *ǫ of Late Proto-Slavic. Another explanation is connected to the adoption of the Old Czech-style orthography of the Latin alphabet to write Polish at the turn of the 16th century. In Poland-Lithuania, Latin still dominated in writing in the Kingdom of Poland, and the Cyrillic-based vernacular of Ruthenian had been in official use in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania since the 13th century. In pronunciation, the Church Cyrillic letter big yus (Ѫ ѫ) corresponds to the pronunciation of the Polish ą. However, it is little yus (Ѧ ѧ), which is phonetically similar to ę and, more importantly, shares visual resemblances with the Latin alphabet initial letter (A, a) plus an ogonek, that some believe led to ogonek's introduction. This, according to proponents of the theory, resulted in the letter ą for denoting the nasal o, when it logically should have been ǫ rather than ą. When the ogonek had already been in place as the diacritic for marking nasality in vowels, it was appended to e, resulting in ę for nasal e. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%84)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ą.", "instruction": "Explain Lithuanian", "response": "The letter often alternates with ę. 'tooth': ząb → zęby ('teeth'), 'snake': wąż → węże ('snakes') 'husband' in nominative: mąż → z mężem ('with husband', in instrumental case) 'weight': ciężar → ciążyć ('to weigh down, to be a burden'), 'month': miesiąc → miesięczny ('monthly'), 'judge': sędzia → sądzić ('to judge, think') 'row' in nominative: rząd → cztery razy z rzędu ('four times in a row', genitive case) However, in words derived from rząd ('government'), the vowel does not change. Thus, rządu (genitive of rząd) retains the ą, e.g., rozporządzenie rządu ('government's ordinance'). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%84)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ą.", "instruction": "Explain The Americas", "response": "In modern Lithuanian, it is no longer nasal and is now pronounced as a long a. It is the second letter of the Lithuanian alphabet called a nosinė (nasal a). The letter is most often found at the end of the noun to construct an ending of accusative case, as in aslą [aːslaː], the accusative of asla (ground, floor); both a and ą in aslą are pronounced [aː] (a long a). Thus, ą is used to distinguish between the transcription of accusative and the nominative cases of the noun asla. It is also used when converting present tense verbs into participles, e.g., (matąs (somebody who is seeing (matyti) right now). Nasal an forms are now pronounced [aː], as in sąrašas (list) and san-grąža (turnover, return). In most cases if a nasal vowel, such as ą, ę, į, ų, appear in the root of an infinitive verb it becomes nasalized, as in kąsti - kanda, kęsti - kenčia, įlįsti - įlindo, skųsti - skundžią. In some cases, ą, ę and į (but never ė) may be used in different forms, as in tąsa (extension) – tęsia (extends) – tįsoti (to lie extended). Finally, some verbs have it in the middle of a word but only in the present tense, e.g., (bąla (is getting white), but not pabalo (has become white). The letter can also be found at the beginning of several words, e.g., ąsotis [aːsoːtis] (jug). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%84)"}
