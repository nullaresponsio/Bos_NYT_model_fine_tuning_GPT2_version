  "assistant": "A dysgerminoma is a type of germ cell tumor; it usually is malignant and usually occurs in the ovary. A tumor of the identical histology but not occurring in the ovary may be described by an alternate name: seminoma in the testis or germinoma in the central nervous system or other parts of the body. Dysgerminoma accounts for less than 1% of ovarian tumors overall. Dysgerminoma usually occurs in adolescence and early adult life; about 5% occur in pre-pubertal children. Dysgerminoma is extremely rare after age 50. Dysgerminoma occurs in both ovaries in 10% of patients and, in a further 10%, there is microscopic tumor in the other ovary. Abnormal gonads (due to gonadal dysgenesis and androgen insensitivity syndrome) have a high risk of developing a dysgerminoma. Most dysgerminomas are associated with elevated serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), which is sometimes used as a tumor marker.\n\nAdenomatoid tumors are rare and benign mesothelial tumors, which arise from the lining of organs. It mainly presents in the genital tract, in regions such as the testis and epididymis. Because of this, researchers had a difficult time concluding that type of tumor has a mesothelial origin. Immunohistochemistry staining of tumor samples show that it is indeed positive for mesothelial-markers (calretinin, WT1, and CK6). It is the most common extratesticular neoplasm after lipoma, and accounts for 30% of these masses. On the other hand, adenomatoid tumors are the most common tumors of testicular adnexa. Although they are more common to be found in the paratesticular region they are sometimes found in the intratesticular region. It also has been found in other organs such as the pancreas, liver, mesocolon, and adrenal glands. In the female, it has been found in the body of the uterus and the fallopian tube. Most adenomatoid tumors do not cause much pain and can go unnoticed for a long time. Of course, there are a few exceptions to this absence of pain. An example of this is when adenomatoid tumors grow too close to testicular adnexal structures. Tumors of this kind are usually found to be asymptomatic and easily treatable.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysgerminoma"
