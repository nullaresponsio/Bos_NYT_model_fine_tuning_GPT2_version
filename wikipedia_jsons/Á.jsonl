{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Á.", "instruction": "Explain Vietnamese", "response": "In Spanish, á is an accented letter. There is no alphabetical or phonological difference between a and á; both sound like /a/, both are considered the same letter, and both have the same value in the Spanish alphabetical order. The accent indicates the stressed syllable in words with irregular stress patterns. It can also be used to \"break up\" a diphthong or to avoid what would otherwise be homonyms, although this does not happen with á, because a is a strong vowel and usually does not become a semivowel in a diphthong. See Diacritic and Acute accent for more details. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81)"}
