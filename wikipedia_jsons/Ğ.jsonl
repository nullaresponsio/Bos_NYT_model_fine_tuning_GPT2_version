{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ğ.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "Ğ (g with breve; minuscule: ğ) is a Latin letter found in the Turkish and Azerbaijani alphabets as well as the Latin alphabets of Zazaki, Laz, Crimean Tatar, Tatar, and Kazakh. It traditionally represented the voiced velar fricative /ɣ/ or the voiced uvular fricative /ʁ/. However, in Turkish, the phoneme has in most cases been reduced to a silent letter, serving as a vowel-lengthener. In Dobrujan Tatar it represents the voiced palato-alveolar affricate /d͡ʒ/. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9E)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ğ.", "instruction": "Explain Historical use", "response": "In Turkish, the ⟨ğ⟩ is known as yumuşak ge (pronounced [jumuˈʃak ˈɟe]; 'soft g') and is the ninth letter of the Turkish alphabet. It always follows a vowel, and can be compared to the blødt g ('soft g') in Danish. Similarly to Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar and other Turkic languages, Turkish used to have a /ɣ/ phoneme which could occur in all positions. However, the phoneme was gradually lost as it fortified to a /g/ if not preceded by a vowel and eroded away elsewhere. The fortified form is now written with a ⟨g⟩, while the eroded form is shown with a ⟨ğ⟩; showing that in native Turkish words which have vowels in contact with each other, there used to be a consonant separating them (in fact Turkish language resources will still insist native words do not have consecutive vowels). In loanwords, consecutive vowels are not separated with a ğ, but in speech they may be separated by a glottal stop, e.g. cemaat or cemaât, which may be pronounced as either [dʒeˈma.atʲ] or [dʒeˈmaʔatʲ].) The realization of the phoneme depends on its location in a word and the surrounding vowels: in word-final and syllable-final positions it lengthens the preceding vowel, for example: dağ(lar) [daː(laɾ)] ('mountain[s]'), sığ [sɯː] ('shallow'); when following a front vowel (e, i), it may sound /j/ instead: değnek [dejnek] ('cane'); between identical back vowels (a, ı, u) it is silent: sığınak [sɯːnak] ('shelter'), uğur [uːɾ] ('good luck'); between identical front vowels (e, i, ü) it is either silent: sevdiğim [sevdiːm] ('that I love'), or pronounced [j]: düğün [dyjyn] ('wedding'); between different rounded vowels (o, u, ö, ü), or between rounded (o, u, ö, ü) and unrounded (a, e) vowels it is mostly silent, but may be a bilabial glide: soğuk [so(w)uk] ('cold'), soğan [so(w)an] ('onion'); ağı may sound as two vowels or as long a: ağır [a.ɯɾ, aːɾ] ('heavy'); ığa is always two vowels: sığan [sɯ.an] ('which fits'); in eği and iğe it is either silent or pronounced [j] as if written y: değil [dejil] ('not'), diğer [dijeɾ] ('other'); in colloquial speech eği is long i: değil [diːl]; eği and ağı in the future suffix -(y)AcAK- are formally [e.i]/[a.ɯ] or colloquially [æ]/[a]: seveceğim [seveˈdʒe.im, seviˈdʒæm] ('I will love'); yazacağım [jazaˈdʒa.ɯm, jazɯˈdʒam] ('I will write'). Some webpages may use ⟨Ð⟩ (uppercase) and ⟨ð⟩ (lowercase) for ⟨Ğ⟩ because of improper encoding; see Turkish characters for the reasons of this. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9E)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ğ.", "instruction": "Explain Azerbaijani and Crimean Tatar use", "response": "The letter, and its counterpart in the Ottoman Turkish alphabet, ⟨غ⟩, were once pronounced as a consonant, /ɣ/, the voiced velar fricative, until very recently in the history of Turkish, but it has undergone a sound change by which the consonant was completely lost and compensatory lengthening of the preceding vowel occurred, hence its function today. The sound change has not completely eliminated the sound in some Turkish dialects. The previous consonantal nature of the sound is evinced by earlier English loanwords from Turkish, such as yogurt/yoghurt (modern Turkish yoğurt) and agha (modern Turkish ağa), and the corresponding velar fricative found in cognate words in the closely related Azerbaijani language and the Turkish-influenced Crimean Tatar language. In Old Turkic (as well as earlier during Proto-Turkic times), this voiced velar fricative originated as an allophone of /ɡ/, the voiced velar stop, when it occurred intervocalically. The expected process of lenition (weakening and eventual loss of the intervocalic Proto-Turkic consonant *ɡ) is thus complete in Turkish and underway in many other Common Turkic languages. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9E)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ğ.", "instruction": "Explain Kazakh use", "response": "The Turkic Tatar language is written mostly in Cyrillic, but a Latin-based alphabet is also in use. In the Latin alphabet, ğ represents /ʁ/, the voiced uvular fricative. In Cyrillic, Tatar uses г for both g and ğ without distinction. Tatar ğ / г is the Arabic ghayn غ. In Arabic words and names where there’s an ayin ع, Tatar adds the ghayn instead (عبد الله, ʻAbd Allāh, ’Abdullah; Tatar: Ğabdulla, Габдулла; Yaña imlâ: غابدوللا /ʁabdulla/). In the Mishar Tatar Dialect, ğ is not pronounced, and thus, a word like şiğır (شعر, шигыр, \"poem\") is şigır or şiyır for Mishars (who in Finland use the Latin alphabet). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9E)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ğ.", "instruction": "Explain Character encoding", "response": "The Faggin–Nazzi alphabet for Friulian language uses the caron, owing to its Slavic influence. However, ⟨Ǧ⟩/⟨ǧ⟩ is often substituted with ⟨Ğ⟩/⟨ğ⟩ due to the former's lack of availability in fonts and input systems. This is because ⟨Ğ⟩/⟨ğ⟩ is in Latin Extended-A alongside ⟨Č⟩/⟨č⟩ and ⟨Š⟩/⟨š⟩, the other caron bearing letters in the alphabet, whereas ⟨Ǧ⟩/⟨ǧ⟩ is in Latin Extended-B, which is available in fewer fonts and input systems. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9E)"}
