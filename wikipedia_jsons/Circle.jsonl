{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Circle.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "A circle is a shape consisting of all points in a plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre. The distance between any point of the circle and the centre is called the radius. The length of a line segment connecting two points on the circle and passing through the centre is called the diameter. A circle bounds a region of the plane called a disc. The circle has been known since before the beginning of recorded history. Natural circles are common, such as the full moon or a slice of round fruit. The circle is the basis for the wheel, which, with related inventions such as gears, makes much of modern machinery possible. In mathematics, the study of the circle has helped inspire the development of geometry, astronomy and calculus. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Circle.", "instruction": "Explain Etymology", "response": "Annulus: a ring-shaped object, the region bounded by two concentric circles. Arc: any connected part of a circle. Specifying two end points of an arc and a centre allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle. Centre: the point equidistant from all points on the circle. Chord: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, thus dividing a circle into two segments. Circumference: the length of one circuit along the circle, or the distance around the circle. Diameter: a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle and that passes through the centre; or the length of such a line segment. This is the largest distance between any two points on the circle. It is a special case of a chord, namely the longest chord for a given circle, and its length is twice the length of a radius. Disc: the region of the plane bounded by a circle. In strict mathematical usage, a circle is only the boundary of the disc (or disk), while in everyday use the term \"circle\" may also refer to a disc. Lens: the region common to (the intersection of) two overlapping discs. Radius: a line segment joining the centre of a circle with any single point on the circle itself; or the length of such a segment, which is half (the length of) a diameter. Usually, the radius is denoted r {\\displaystyle r} and required to be a positive number. A circle with r = 0 {\\displaystyle r=0} is a degenerate case consisting of a single point. Sector: a region bounded by two radii of equal length with a common centre and either of the two possible arcs, determined by this centre and the endpoints of the radii. Segment: a region bounded by a chord and one of the arcs connecting the chord's endpoints. The length of the chord imposes a lower boundary on the diameter of possible arcs. Sometimes the term segment is used only for regions not containing the centre of the circle to which their arc belongs. Secant: an extended chord, a coplanar straight line, intersecting a circle in two points. Semicircle: one of the two possible arcs determined by the endpoints of a diameter, taking its midpoint as centre. In non-technical common usage it may mean the interior of the two-dimensional region bounded by a diameter and one of its arcs, that is technically called a half-disc. A half-disc is a special case of a segment, namely the largest one. Tangent: a coplanar straight line that has one single point in common with a circle (\"touches the circle at this point\"). All of the specified regions may be considered as open, that is, not containing their boundaries, or as closed, including their respective boundaries. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle)"}

Disc-shaped prehistoric artifacts include the Nebra sky disc and jade discs called Bi. The Egyptian Rhind papyrus, dated to 1700 BCE, gives a method to find the area of a circle. The result corresponds to ‚Å†256/81‚Å† (3.16049...) as an approximate value of œÄ. Book 3 of Euclid's Elements deals with the properties of circles. Euclid's definition of a circle is: A circle is a plane figure bounded by one curved line, and such that all straight lines drawn from a certain point within it to the bounding line, are equal. The bounding line is called its circumference and the point, its centre. In Plato's Seventh Letter there is a detailed definition and explanation of the circle. Plato explains the perfect circle, and how it is different from any drawing, words, definition or explanation. Early science, particularly geometry and astrology and astronomy, was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars, and many believed that there was something intrinsically \"divine\" or \"perfect\" that could be found in circles. In 1880 CE, Ferdinand von Lindemann proved that œÄ is transcendental, proving that the millennia-old problem of squaring the circle cannot be performed with straightedge and compass. With the advent of abstract art in the early 20th century, geometric objects became an artistic subject in their own right. Wassily Kandinsky in particular often used circles as an element of his compositions. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle)"}

However, differences in worldview (beliefs and culture) had a great impact on artists' perceptions. While some emphasised the circle's perimeter to demonstrate their democratic manifestation, others focused on its centre to symbolise the concept of cosmic unity. In mystical doctrines, the circle mainly symbolises the infinite and cyclical nature of existence, but in religious traditions it represents heavenly bodies and divine spirits. The circle signifies many sacred and spiritual concepts, including unity, infinity, wholeness, the universe, divinity, balance, stability and perfection, among others. Such concepts have been conveyed in cultures worldwide through the use of symbols, for example, a compass, a halo, the vesica piscis and its derivatives (fish, eye, aureole, mandorla, etc.), the ouroboros, the Dharma wheel, a rainbow, mandalas, rose windows and so forth.

Thus, if A, B, and C are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points P satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a line is a generalised circle of infinite radius. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Circle.", "instruction": "Explain Limiting case of other figures", "response": "In every triangle a unique circle, called the incircle, can be inscribed such that it is tangent to each of the three sides of the triangle. About every triangle a unique circle, called the circumcircle, can be circumscribed such that it goes through each of the triangle's three vertices. A tangential polygon, such as a tangential quadrilateral, is any convex polygon within which a circle can be inscribed that is tangent to each side of the polygon. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a tangential polygon. A cyclic polygon is any convex polygon about which a circle can be circumscribed, passing through each vertex. A well-studied example is the cyclic quadrilateral. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a bicentric polygon. A hypocycloid is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Circle.", "instruction": "Explain Locus of constant sum", "response": "The circle can be viewed as a limiting case of various other figures: The series of regular polygons with n sides has the circle as its limit as n approaches infinity. This fact was applied by Archimedes to approximate œÄ. A Cartesian oval is a set of points such that a weighted sum of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points (foci) is a constant. An ellipse is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an eccentricity of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero. A superellipse has an equation of the form | x a | n + | y b | n = 1 {\\displaystyle \\left|{\\frac {x}{a}}\\right|^{n}\\!+\\left|{\\frac {y}{b}}\\right|^{n}\\!=1} for positive a, b, and n. A supercircle has b = a. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which n = 2. A Cassini oval is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results. A curve of constant width is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle)"}

The locus of points such that the sum of the squares of the distances to the given points is constant is a circle, whose centre is at the centroid of the given points. A generalisation for higher powers of distances is obtained if, instead of n {\\displaystyle n} points, the vertices of the regular polygon P n {\\displaystyle P_{n}} are taken. The locus of points such that the sum of the 2 m {\\displaystyle 2m} -th power of distances d i {\\displaystyle d_{i}} to the vertices of a given regular polygon with circumradius R {\\displaystyle R} is constant is a circle, if ‚àë i = 1 n d i 2 m > n R 2 m , where m = 1 , 2 , ‚Ä¶ , n ‚àí 1 ; {\\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^{n}d_{i}^{2m}>nR^{2m},\\quad {\\text{ where }}~m=1,2,\\dots ,n-1;} whose centre is the centroid of the P n {\\displaystyle P_{n}} .

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Circle.", "instruction": "Explain Generalisations", "response": "Squaring the circle is the problem, proposed by ancient geometers, of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge. In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann‚ÄìWeierstrass theorem, which proves that pi (œÄ) is a transcendental number, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. Despite the impossibility, this topic continues to be of interest for pseudomath enthusiasts. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Circle.", "instruction": "Explain Topological definition", "response": "Defining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In p-norm, distance is determined by ‚Äñ x ‚Äñ p = ( | x 1 | p + | x 2 | p + ‚ãØ + | x n | p ) 1 / p . {\\displaystyle \\left\\|x\\right\\|_{p}=\\left(\\left|x_{1}\\right|^{p}+\\left|x_{2}\\right|^{p}+\\dotsb +\\left|x_{n}\\right|^{p}\\right)^{1/p}.} In Euclidean geometry, p = 2, giving the familiar ‚Äñ x ‚Äñ 2 = | x 1 | 2 + | x 2 | 2 + ‚ãØ + | x n | 2 . {\\displaystyle \\left\\|x\\right\\|_{2}={\\sqrt {\\left|x_{1}\\right|^{2}+\\left|x_{2}\\right|^{2}+\\dotsb +\\left|x_{n}\\right|^{2}}}.} In taxicab geometry, p = 1. Taxicab circles are squares with sides oriented at a 45¬∞ angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length 2 r {\\displaystyle {\\sqrt {2}}r} using a Euclidean metric, where r is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2r. Thus, a circle's circumference is 8r. Thus, the value of a geometric analog to œÄ {\\displaystyle \\pi } is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is | x | + | y | = 1 {\\displaystyle |x|+|y|=1} in Cartesian coordinates and r = 1 | sin ‚Å° Œ∏ | + | cos ‚Å° Œ∏ | {\\displaystyle r={\\frac {1}{\\left|\\sin \\theta \\right|+\\left|\\cos \\theta \\right|}}} in polar coordinates. A circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the von Neumann neighborhood of its centre. A circle of radius r for the Chebyshev distance (L‚àû metric) on a plane is also a square with side length 2r parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L1 and L‚àû metrics does not generalise to higher dimensions. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle)"}
