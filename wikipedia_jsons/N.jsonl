{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on N.", "instruction": "Explain Use in writing systems", "response": "One of the most common hieroglyphs, snake, was used in Egyptian writing to stand for a sound like the English ‚ü®J‚ü©, because the Egyptian word for \"snake\" was djet. It is speculated by some, such as archeologist Douglas Petrovich, that Semitic speakers working in Egypt adapted hieroglyphs to create the first alphabet. Some hold that they used the same snake symbol to represent N, with a great proponent of this theory being Alan Gardiner, because their word for \"snake\" may have begun with n (an example of a possible word being nahash). However, this theory has become disputed. The name for the letter in the Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic alphabets is nun, which means \"fish\" in some of these languages. This possibly connects the letter to the hieroglyph for a water ripple, which phonetically makes the n sound. The sound value of the letter was /n/‚Äîas in Greek, Etruscan, Latin, and modern languages. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on N.", "instruction": "Explain Other languages", "response": "In English, ‚ü®n‚ü© usually represents a voiced alveolar nasal /n/, but can represent other nasal consonants due to assimilation. For example, before a velar plosive (as in ink or jungle), ‚ü®n‚ü© represents a voiced velar nasal /≈ã/. ‚ü®n‚ü© is generally silent when it is preceded by an ‚ü®m‚ü© at the end of words, as in hymn; however, it is pronounced in this combination when occurring word medially, as in hymnal. Other consonants are often silent when they precede an ‚ü®n‚ü© at the beginning of an English word. Examples include gnome, knife, mnemonic, and pneumonia. The letter N is the sixth-most common letter and the second-most commonly used consonant in the English language (after ‚ü®t‚ü©). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on N.", "instruction": "Explain Other systems", "response": "The letter ‚ü®n‚ü© represents a voiced dental nasal /nÃ™/ or voiced alveolar nasal /n/ in virtually all languages that use the Latin alphabet. In many languages, these nasal consonants assimilate with the consonant that follows them to produce other nasal consonants. In Italian and French, ‚ü®gn‚ü© represents a palatal nasal /…≤/. The Portuguese and Vietnamese spelling for this sound is ‚ü®nh‚ü©, while Spanish, Breton, and a few other languages use the letter ‚ü®√±‚ü©. A common digraph with ‚ü®n‚ü© is ‚ü®ng‚ü©, which represents a voiced velar nasal /≈ã/ in a variety of languages. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N)"}
