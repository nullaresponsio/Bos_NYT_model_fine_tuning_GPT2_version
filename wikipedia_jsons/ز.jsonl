{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ز.", "instruction": "Explain Arabic zāy", "response": "The Proto-Sinaitic glyph may have been called ziqq, may not have been based on a hieroglyph, and may have depicted a \"fetter\". An alternative view is that it is based on the \"copper ingot\" hieroglyph (𓈔) in the form of an axeblade, after noting that the name \"zayin\" has roots in Aramaic to refer to \"Arms,\" \"Armor,\" and \"Metal used for arms.\" The Phoenician letter appears to be named after a sword or other weapon. In Hebrew, zayin (זין‎) means \"weapon\", the verb lĕzayyēn (לזיין‎) means \"to arm\", and the verb lĕhizdayyēn (להזדיין‎) means \"to arm oneself\". <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zayin)"}
