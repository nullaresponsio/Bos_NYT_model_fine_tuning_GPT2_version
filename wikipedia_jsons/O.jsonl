{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on O.", "instruction": "Explain Use in writing systems", "response": "Its graphic form has remained fairly constant from Phoenician times until today. The name of the Phoenician letter was  øeyn, meaning \"eye\", and its shape originates simply as a drawing of a human eye (possibly inspired by the corresponding Egyptian hieroglyph, cf. Proto-Sinaitic script). Its original sound value was that of a consonant, probably [ ï], the sound represented by the cognate Arabic letter ÿπ  øayn. The use of this Phoenician letter for a vowel sound is due to the early Greek alphabets, which adopted the letter \"omicron\" to represent the vowel /o/. The letter was adopted with the value in the Old Italic alphabets, including the early Latin alphabet. In Greek, a variation of the form later came to differentiate this long sound (omega, meaning \"large O\") from the short o (Omicron, meaning \"small o\"). The Greek omicron gave rise to the corresponding Cyrillic letter O. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on O.", "instruction": "Explain Other languages", "response": "The letter ‚ü®o‚ü© is the fourth most common letter in the English alphabet. Like the other English vowel letters, it has associated \"long\" and \"short\" pronunciations. The \"long\" ‚ü®o‚ü© as in boat is actually most often a diphthong (realized dialectically anywhere from [o] to […ô ä]). In English, there is also a \"short\" ‚ü®o‚ü© as in fox, , which sounds slightly different in different dialects. In most dialects of British English, it is either an open-mid back rounded vowel […î] or an open back rounded vowel […í]; in American English, it is most commonly an unrounded back […ë] to a central vowel [a]. Common digraphs include ‚ü®oo‚ü©, which represents either or ; ‚ü®oi‚ü© or ‚ü®oy‚ü©, which typically represents the diphthong , and ‚ü®ao‚ü©, ‚ü®oe‚ü©, and ‚ü®ou‚ü© which represent a variety of pronunciations depending on context and etymology. In other contexts, especially before a letter with a minim, ‚ü®o‚ü© may represent the sound , as in 'son' or 'love'. It can also represent the semivowel , as in choir or quinoa. \"O\" in isolation is a word, also spelled \"oh\" and pronounced /o ä/. Before a noun, usually capitalized, it indicates direct address (the vocative case), as in the titles \"O Canada\" or \"O Captain! My Captain!\" or in certain verses of the Bible. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on O.", "instruction": "Explain Other systems", "response": "‚ü®o‚ü© is commonly associated with the open-mid back rounded vowel […î], mid back rounded vowel [oÃû] or close-mid back rounded vowel [o] in many languages. Other languages use ‚ü®o‚ü© for various values, usually back vowels which are at least partly open. Derived letters such as ‚ü®√∂‚ü© and ‚ü®√∏‚ü© have been created for the alphabets of some languages to distinguish values that were not present in Latin and Greek, particularly rounded front vowels. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O)"}
