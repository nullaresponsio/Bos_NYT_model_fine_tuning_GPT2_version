{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on V.", "instruction": "Explain History", "response": "Catalan: ve (pronounced [Ààve]); in dialects that lack contrast between /v/ and /b/, the letter is called ve baixa [Ààbe Ààbaj É…ô], \"low B/V\". Czech: v√© ['v…õÀê] French: v√© ['ve] German: Vau [Ààfa ä] Italian: vi [Ààvi] or vu [Ààvu] Japanese: ‚ü®v‚ü© is called a variety of names originating in English, most commonly „Éñ„Ç§ [b…Øi] or [bui], but less nativized variants, violating to an extent the phonotactics of Japanese, of „É¥„Ç£„Éº [viÀê], „É¥„Ç§ [v…Øi] or [vui], and „É¥„Ç£ [vi] are also used. The phoneme /v/ in Japanese is used properly only in loanwords, where the preference for either /v/ or /b/ depends on many factors; in general, words that are perceived to be in common use tend toward /b/. Polish: fa≈Ç ['faw] Portuguese: v√™ [Ààve] Spanish: uve [ÀàuŒ≤e] is recommended, but ve [Ààbe] is traditional. If ‚ü®v‚ü© is referred to as the latter, it would have the same pronunciation as the letter ‚ü®b‚ü© in Spanish (i.e. [Ààbe] after pause or nasal sound, otherwise [ÀàŒ≤e]); thus further terms are needed to distinguish ve from be. In some countries it is called ve corta, ve baja, ve peque√±a, ve chica or ve labiodental. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on V.", "instruction": "Explain Use in writing systems", "response": "The letter ‚ü®v‚ü© ultimately comes from the Phoenician letter waw by way of ‚ü®u‚ü©. During the Late Middle Ages, two minuscule glyphs of U developed which were both used for sounds including /u/ and modern /v/. The pointed form ‚ü®v‚ü© was written at the beginning of a word, while a rounded form ‚ü®u‚ü© was used in the middle or end, regardless of sound. So whereas valour and excuse appeared as in modern printing, have and upon were printed as \"haue\" and \"vpon\". The first distinction between the letters ‚ü®v‚ü© and ‚ü®u‚ü© is recorded in a Gothic script from 1386, where ‚ü®v‚ü© preceded ‚ü®u‚ü©. By the mid-16th century, the ‚ü®v‚ü© form was used to represent the consonant and ‚ü®u‚ü© the vowel sound, giving us the modern letter ‚ü®v‚ü©. ‚ü®u‚ü© and ‚ü®v‚ü© were not accepted as distinct letters until many years later. The rounded variant became the modern-day version of ‚ü®u‚ü©, and the letter's former pointed form became ‚ü®v‚ü©. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on V.", "instruction": "Explain Romance languages", "response": "In English, ‚ü®v‚ü© represents a voiced labiodental fricative. Special rules of orthography normally apply to the letter ‚ü®v‚ü©: Traditionally, ‚ü®v‚ü© is not doubled to indicate a short vowel, the way, for example, ‚ü®p‚ü© is doubled to indicate the difference between super and supper. However, that is changing with newly coined words, such as savvy, divvy up and skivvies. A word-final sound (except in of) is normally spelled -‚ü®ve‚ü©, regardless of the pronunciation of the vowel before it. This rule does not apply to transliterations of Slavic and Hebrew words, such as Kyiv (Kiev), or to words that started out as abbreviations, such as sov for sovereign. The sound is spelled ‚ü®o‚ü©, not ‚ü®u‚ü©, before the letter ‚ü®v‚ü©. This originated with a mediaeval scribal practice designed to increase legibility by avoiding too many vertical strokes (minims) in a row. Like ‚ü®j‚ü©, ‚ü®k‚ü©, ‚ü®w‚ü©, ‚ü®x‚ü© and ‚ü®z‚ü©, ‚ü®v‚ü© is not used very frequently in English. It is the sixth least frequently used letter in the English language, occurring in roughly 1% of words. ‚ü®v‚ü© is the only letter that cannot be used to form an English two-letter word in the British and Australian versions of the game of Scrabble. It is one of only two letters (the other being ‚ü®c‚ü©) that cannot be used this way in the American version. ‚ü®v‚ü© is also the only letter in the English language that is never silent. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on V.", "instruction": "Explain Other languages", "response": "The letter represents /v/ in several Romance languages, but in others it represents the same sound as ‚ü®b‚ü©, i.e. /b/, due to a process known as betacism. Betacism occurs in most dialects of Spanish, in some dialects of Catalan and Portuguese, as well as in Aragonese, Asturleonese and Galician. In Spanish, the phoneme has two main allophones; in most environments, it is pronounced [Œ≤Ãû], but after a pause or a nasal it is typically [b]. See Allophones of /b d g/ in Spanish phonology for a more thorough discussion. In Corsican, ‚ü®v‚ü© represents [b], [v], [Œ≤] or [w], depending on the position in the word and the sentence. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on V.", "instruction": "Explain Other systems", "response": "In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, ‚ü®v‚ü© represents a voiced bilabial or labiodental sound. In contemporary German, it represents /v/ in most loanwords, while in native German words, it always represents /f/. In standard Dutch, it traditionally represents /v/, but in many regions, it represents /f/ in some or all positions. In the Latinization of the Cherokee syllabary, ‚ü®v‚ü© represents a nasalized schwa, /…ôÃÉ/. In Chinese pinyin, while v is not used, the letter ‚ü®v‚ü© is used by most input methods to enter the letter ‚ü®√º‚ü©, which most keyboards lack (romanized-input Chinese is a popular method to enter Chinese text). Informal romanizations of Mandarin Chinese use ‚ü®v‚ü© as a substitute for the close front rounded vowel /y/, properly written ‚ü®√º‚ü© in both pinyin and Wade‚ÄìGiles. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V)"}
