Activity of ABL1 protein is negatively regulated by its SH3 domain, and deletion of the SH3 domain turns ABL1 into an oncogene. The t(9;22) translocation results in the head-to-tail fusion of the BCR and ABL1 genes, leading to a fusion gene present in many cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The DNA-binding activity of the ubiquitously expressed ABL1 tyrosine kinase is regulated by CDC2-mediated phosphorylation, suggesting a cell cycle function for ABL1. The ABL1 gene is expressed as either a 6- or a 7-kb mRNA transcript, with alternatively spliced first exons spliced to the common exons 2â€“11. == Clinical significance == Mutations in the ABL1 gene are associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In CML, the gene is activated by being translocated within the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. This new fusion gene, BCR-ABL, encodes an unregulated, cytoplasm-targeted tyrosine kinase that allows the cells to proliferate without being regulated by cytokines. This, in turn, allows the cell to become cancerous. This gene is a partner in a fusion gene with the BCR gene in the Philadelphia chromosome, a characteristic abnormality in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and rarely in some other leukemia forms. The BCR-ABL transcript encodes a tyrosine kinase, which activates mediators of the cell cycle regulation system, leading to a clonal myeloproliferative disorder. The BCR-ABL protein can be inhibited by various small molecules. One such inhibitor is imatinib mesylate, which occupies the tyrosine kinase domain and inhibits BCR-ABL's influence on the cell cycle. Second generation BCR-ABL tyrosine-kinase inhibitors are also under development to inhibit BCR-ABL mutants resistant to imatinib. == Interactions == ABL gene has been shown to interact with: == Regulation == There is some evidence that the expression of Abl is regulated by the microRNA miR-203. == See also == BCR gene == References == == Further reading == == External links == Genes,+abl at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM): 189980 (ABL) Abelson+Leukemia+Virus at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Drosophila Abl tyrosine kinase - The Interactive Fly ABL1 Info with links in the Cell Migration Gateway ABL1 on the Atlas of Genetics and Oncology Human ABL1 genome location and ABL1 gene details page in the UCSC Genome Browser.
