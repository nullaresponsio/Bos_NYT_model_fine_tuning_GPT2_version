It has a basal layer and a functional layer: the basal layer contains stem cells which regenerate the functional layer. The functional layer thickens and then is shed during menstruation in humans and some other mammals, including other apes, Old World monkeys, some species of bat, the elephant shrew and the Cairo spiny mouse. In most other mammals, the endometrium is reabsorbed in the estrous cycle. During pregnancy, the glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number. Vascular spaces fuse and become interconnected, forming the placenta, which supplies oxygen and nutrition to the embryo and fetus. The speculated presence of an endometrial microbiota has been argued against.\n\nAdenomyosis is a medical condition characterized by the growth of cells that proliferate on the inside of the uterus (endometrium) atypically located among the cells of the uterine wall (myometrium), as a result, thickening of the uterus occurs. As well as being misplaced in patients with this condition, endometrial tissue is completely functional. The tissue thickens, sheds and bleeds during every menstrual cycle. The condition is typically found in women between the ages of 35 and 50, but also affects younger women. Patients with adenomyosis often present with painful menses (dysmenorrhea), profuse menses (menorrhagia), or both. Other possible symptoms are pain during sexual intercourse, chronic pelvic pain and irritation of the urinary bladder. In adenomyosis, basal endometrium penetrates into hyperplastic myometrial fibers. Unlike the functional layer, the basal layer does not undergo typical cyclic changes with the menstrual cycle. Adenomyosis may involve the uterus focally, creating an adenomyoma. With diffuse involvement, the uterus becomes bulky and heavier. Adenomyosis can be found together with endometriosis; it differs in that patients with endometriosis present endometrial-like tissue located entirely outside the uterus. In endometriosis, the tissue is similar to, but not the same as, the endometrium. The two conditions are found together in many cases yet often occur separately. Before being recognized as a distinct condition, adenomyosis was called endometriosis interna. The less-commonly-used term adenomyometritis is a more specific name for the condition, specifying involvement of the uterus.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrium"
