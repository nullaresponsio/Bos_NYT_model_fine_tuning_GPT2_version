  "assistant": "Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy is a monthly peer-reviewed medical journal published by Springer Science+Business Media. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2020 impact factor of 6.968. As of 2024, the impact factor is 4.8. Immunology includes the use of certain components of the immune system ( antibodies, cells & cytokines), etc. for the treatment of various cancers and autoimmune diseases and the manipulation of immune system through vaccines for the prevention and treatment of infectious and allergic diseases. What Kind of cancer does immunotherapy treat? Immunotherapy is a promising treatment option for advanced lung cancer, alone or in combination with conventional treatments like chemotherapy or surgery. Several FDA- approved immunotherapies offer treatment options to children and adults with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Can you survive cancer with immunotherapy? Immunotherapy has shown success in 15 different types of cancers including lung cancer, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nAcademic publishing is the subfield of publishing which distributes academic research and scholarship. Most academic work is published in academic journal articles, books or theses. The part of academic written output that is not formally published but merely printed up or posted on the Internet is often called \"grey literature\". Most scientific and scholarly journals, and many academic and scholarly books, though not all, are based on some form of peer review or editorial refereeing to qualify texts for publication. Peer review quality and selectivity standards vary greatly from journal to journal, publisher to publisher, and field to field. Most established academic disciplines have their own journals and other outlets for publication, although many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields. There is also a tendency for existing journals to divide into specialized sections as the field itself becomes more specialized. Along with the variation in review and publication procedures, the kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions to knowledge or research differ greatly among fields and subfields. In the sciences, the desire for statistically significant results leads to publication bias. Academic publishing is undergoing major changes as it makes the transition from the print to the electronic format. Business models are different in the electronic environment. Since the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common. An important trend, particularly with respect to journals in the sciences, is open access via the Internet. In open access publishing, a journal article is made available free for all on the web by the publisher at the time of publication. Both open and closed journals are sometimes funded by the author paying an article processing charge, thereby shifting some fees from the reader to the researcher or their funder. Many open or closed journals fund their operations without such fees and others use them in predatory publishing. The Internet has facilitated open access self-archiving, in which authors themselves make a copy of their published articles available free for all on the web. Some important results in mathematics have been published only on arXiv.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Immunology,_Immunotherapy"
