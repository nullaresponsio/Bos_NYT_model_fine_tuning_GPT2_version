Factors include differences in beliefs, attitudes, and treatment options that impact diverse populations throughout the world.\n\nAfrican Americans, also known as Black Americans and formerly also called Afro-Americans, are an American racial and ethnic group, who as defined by the United States census, consists of Americans who have \"origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa\". African Americans constitute the second largest ethno-racial group in the US after White Americans. The term \"African American\" generally denotes descendants of Africans enslaved in the United States. African-American history began in the 16th century, with Africans being sold to European slave traders and transported across the Atlantic to the Western Hemisphere. They were sold as slaves to European colonists and put to work on plantations, particularly in the southern colonies. A few were able to achieve freedom through manumission or escape, and founded independent communities before and during the American Revolution. After the United States was founded in 1783, most Black people continued to be enslaved, primarily concentrated in the American South, with four million enslaved people only liberated with the Civil War in 1865. During Reconstruction, they gained citizenship and adult-males the right to vote; however, due to widespread White supremacy, they were treated as second-class citizens and soon disenfranchised in the South. These circumstances changed due to participation in the military conflicts of the United States, substantial migration out of the South, the elimination of legal racial segregation, and the civil rights movement which sought political and social freedom. However, racism against African Americans and racial socioeconomic disparity remain a problem into the 21st century. In the 20th and 21st centuries, immigration has played an increasingly significant role in the African-American community. As of 2022, 10% of Black Americans were immigrants, and 20% were either immigrants or the children of immigrants. African-American culture has had a significant influence on worldwide culture, making numerous contributions to visual arts, literature, the English language, philosophy, politics, cuisine, sports, and music. The African-American contribution to popular music is so profound that most American music, including jazz, gospel, blues, rock and roll, funk, disco, house, techno, hip hop, R&B, trap, and soul, has its origins either partially or entirely in the African-American community.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_differences_in_breast_cancer_diagnosis_and_treatment"
