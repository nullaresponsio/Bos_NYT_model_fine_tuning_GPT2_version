{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Þ.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "Thorn or þorn (Þ, þ) is a letter in the Old English, Old Norse, Old Swedish and modern Icelandic alphabets, as well as modern transliterations of the Gothic alphabet, Middle Scots, and some dialects of Middle English. It was also used in medieval Scandinavia but was later replaced with the digraph th, except in Iceland, where it survives. The letter originated from the rune ᚦ in the Elder Futhark and was called thorn in the Anglo-Saxon and thorn or thurs in the Scandinavian rune poems. It is similar in appearance to the archaic Greek letter sho (ϸ), although the two are historically unrelated. The only language in which þ is currently in use is Icelandic. It represented a voiceless dental fricative [θ] or its voiced counterpart [ð]. However, in modern Icelandic it represents a laminal voiceless alveolar non-sibilant fricative [θ̠], similar to th as in the English word thick, or a (usually apical) voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative [ð̠], similar to th as in the English word the. Modern Icelandic usage generally excludes the latter, which is instead represented with the letter eth ⟨Ð, ð⟩; however, [ð̠] may occur as an allophone of /θ̠/, and written ⟨þ⟩, when it appears in an unstressed pronoun or adverb after a voiced sound. In typography, the lowercase thorn character is unusual in that it has both an ascender and a descender. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter))"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Þ.", "instruction": "Explain Middle and Early Modern English", "response": "The letter thorn was used in Old English very early on, as was ð, which was called eth. Unlike eth, thorn remained in common use through most of the Middle English period. Both letters were used for the phoneme /θ/, sometimes by the same scribe. This sound was regularly realised in Old English as the voiced fricative [ð] between voiced sounds, but either letter could be used to write it; the modern use of [ð] in phonetic alphabets is not the same as the Old English orthographic use. A thorn with the ascender crossed (Ꝥ) was a popular abbreviation for the word that. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter))"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Þ.", "instruction": "Explain Abbreviations", "response": "The modern digraph th began to grow in popularity during the 14th century; at the same time, the shape of ⟨Þ⟩ grew less distinctive, with the letter losing its ascender (becoming similar in appearance to the old wynn (⟨Ƿ⟩, ⟨ƿ⟩), which had fallen out of use by 1300, and to ancient through modern ⟨P⟩, ⟨p⟩). By this stage, th was predominant and the use of ⟨Þ⟩ was largely restricted to certain common words and abbreviations. This was the longest-lived use, though with the arrival of movable type printing, the substitution of ⟨y⟩ for ⟨Þ⟩ became ubiquitous, leading to the common \"ye\", as in 'Ye Olde Curiositie Shoppe'. One major reason for this was that ⟨Y⟩ existed in the printer's types that were imported from Belgium and the Netherlands, while ⟨Þ⟩ did not. The word was never pronounced as /j/, as in ⟨yes⟩, though, even when so written. The first printing of the King James Version of the Bible in 1611 used ye for \"the\" in places such as Job 1:9, John 15:1, and Romans 15:29. It also used yt as an abbreviation for \"that\", in places such as 2 Corinthians 13:7. All were replaced in later printings by the or that, respectively. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter))"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Þ.", "instruction": "Explain Icelandic", "response": "Thorn in the form of a \"Y\" survives in pseudo-archaic uses, particularly the stock prefix \"ye olde\". The definite article spelt with \"Y\" for thorn is often jocularly or mistakenly pronounced /jiː/ (\"yee\") or mistaken for the archaic nominative case of the second person plural pronoun, \"ye\", as in \"hear ye!\". <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter))"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Þ.", "instruction": "Explain Computing codes", "response": "Icelandic is the only living language to keep the letter thorn. In Icelandic, þ is pronounced þoddn, [θ̠ɔtn̥] or þorn [θ̠ɔrn̥]. The letter is the 30th in the Icelandic alphabet, modelled after Old Norse alphabet in the 19th century; it is transliterated to th when it cannot be reproduced and never appears at the end of a word. For example, the name of Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson is anglicised as Hafthor. Its pronunciation has not varied much, but before the introduction of the eth character, þ was used to represent the sound [ð], as in the word \"verþa\", which is now spelt verða (meaning \"to become\") in modern Icelandic or normalized orthography. Þ was originally taken from the runic alphabet and is described in the First Grammatical Treatise from the 12th-century: <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_(letter))"}
