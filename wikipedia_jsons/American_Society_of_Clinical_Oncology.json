  "assistant": "The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) is a professional organization representing physicians of all oncology sub-specialties who care for people with cancer. Founded in 1964 by Fred Ansfield, Harry Bisel, Herman Freckman, Arnoldus Goudsmit, Robert Talley, William Wilson, and Jane C. Wright, it has nearly 45,000 members worldwide.\n\nAlexandria is an independent city in Northern Virginia, United States. It lies on the western bank of the Potomac River approximately 7 miles (11 km) south of D.C. The city's population of 159,467 at the 2020 census made it the sixth-most populous city in Virginia and 169th-most populous city in the U.S. Alexandria is a principal city of the Washington metropolitan area, which is part of the larger Washingtonâ€“Baltimore combined statistical area. Like the rest of Northern Virginia and Central Maryland, present-day Alexandria has been influenced by its proximity to the U.S. capital. It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, in the U.S. military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the U.S. federal government. The city's largest employers include the U.S. Department of Defense and the Institute for Defense Analyses. Alexandria is the highest-income independent city in Virginia. The historic center of Alexandria is known as Old Town Alexandria, or simply \"Old Town\". With its concentration of boutiques, restaurants, antique shops and theaters, it is a major draw for city residents and visitors. Like Old Town, many Alexandria neighborhoods are compact and walkable. A large portion of adjacent Fairfax County, mostly south but also west of the city, has Alexandria mailing addresses. However, this area is under the jurisdiction of Fairfax County's government and separate from the independent city. The city is therefore sometimes referred to as the \"City of Alexandria\" to avoid confusion.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_of_Clinical_Oncology"
