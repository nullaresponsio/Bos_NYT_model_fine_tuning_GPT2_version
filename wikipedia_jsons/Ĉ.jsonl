{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ĉ.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "Ĉ or ĉ (C circumflex) is a consonant in Esperanto orthography, representing the sound [t͡ʃ], the pronunciation of the English ⟨ch⟩ as in \"cheese\". It is based on the letter ⟨c⟩. Esperanto orthography uses a diacritic for all four of its postalveolar consonants, as do the Latin-based Slavic alphabets. Letters and digraphs that are similar to ⟨ĉ⟩ and represent the same sound include Slovene and Croatian ⟨č⟩, Albanian ⟨ç⟩, Polish digraph ⟨cz⟩, English and Spanish digraph ⟨ch⟩, French trigraph ⟨tch⟩, German tetragraph ⟨tsch⟩, Hungarian digraph ⟨cs⟩, Basque and Catalan digraph ⟨tx⟩ and Italian ⟨ci⟩ and ⟨e⟩. ⟨Ĉ⟩ is the fourth letter in Esperanto orthography. Although it is written as ⟨c⟩x and ⟨c⟩h respectively in the x-system and h-system workarounds, it is normally written as ⟨C⟩ with a circumflex: ⟨ĉ⟩. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%88)"}
