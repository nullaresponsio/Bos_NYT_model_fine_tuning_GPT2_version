{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on E.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "E, or e, is the fifth letter and the second vowel letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is e (pronounced ); plural es, Es, or E's. It is the most commonly used letter in many languages, including Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Latin, Latvian, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on E.", "instruction": "Explain History", "response": "In English, the name of the letter is the \"long E\" sound, pronounced . In most other languages, its name matches the letter's pronunciation in open syllables. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on E.", "instruction": "Explain Use in writing systems", "response": "The Latin letter 'E' differs little from its source, the Greek letter epsilon, 'Ε'. This in turn comes from the Semitic letter hê, which has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (hillul, 'jubilation'), and was most likely based on a similar Egyptian hieroglyph that indicated a different pronunciation. In Semitic, the letter represented /h/ (and /e/ in foreign words); in Greek, hê became the letter epsilon, used to represent /e/. The various forms of the Old Italic script and the Latin alphabet followed this usage. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on E.", "instruction": "Explain Other languages", "response": "Although Middle English spelling used ⟨e⟩ to represent long and short /e/, the Great Vowel Shift changed long /eː/ (as in me or bee) to /iː/ while short /ɛ/ (as in met or bed) remained a mid vowel. In unstressed syllables, this letter is usually pronounced either as /ɪ/ or /ə/. In other cases, the letter is silent, generally at the end of words like queue. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on E.", "instruction": "Explain Other systems", "response": "In the orthography of many languages, it represents either [e], [e̞], [ɛ], or some variation (such as a nasalized version) of these sounds, often with diacritics (as: ⟨e ê é è ë ē ĕ ě ẽ ė ẹ ę ẻ⟩) to indicate contrasts. Less commonly, as in French, German, or Saanich, ⟨e⟩ represents a mid-central vowel /ə/. Digraphs with ⟨e⟩ are common to indicate either diphthongs or monophthongs, such as ⟨ea⟩ or ⟨ee⟩ for /iː/ or /eɪ/ in English, ⟨ei⟩ for /aɪ/ in German, and ⟨eu⟩ for /ø/ in French or /ɔɪ/ in German. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E)"}
