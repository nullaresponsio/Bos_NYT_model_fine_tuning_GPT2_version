{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on M.", "instruction": "Explain Related characters", "response": "The Roman numeral M represents the number 1000, though it was not used in Roman times. There is, however, scant evidence that the letter was later introduced in the early centuries A.D. by the Romans. Unit prefix M (mega), meaning one million times, and m (milli) meaning one-thousandth. m is the standard abbreviation for metre (or meter) in the International System of Units (SI). However, m is also used as an abbreviation for mile. M is used as the unit abbreviation for molarity. With money amounts, m or M is ambiguous. In the finance industry, m or M means 1,000. In this context, five million dollars is written $5mm or $5MM. Outside of finance, some people use M like the metric system \"mega-\" to mean one million and write $5M. M often represents male or masculine, especially in conjunction with F for female or feminine. In typography, an em dash is a punctuation symbol whose width is similar to that of a capital letter M. M is used as a logo by many rapid transit systems, standing for \"Metro\" (or equivalents in other languages.) <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M)"}
