It was founded in 2011 by Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath. As of October 2024, various media outlets reported that Byju's valuation has now plummeted to zero, down from its peak valuation of $22 billion in 2022. In April 2023, the company claimed it had over 150 million registered students. In April 2024, according to a report by the Times of India, Byju's has laid off approximately 500 employees, mainly from its sales and marketing departments. The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in July 2024 allowed Byju's parent Think and Learn to move forward insolvency proceedings in a plea filed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over unpaid dues amounting to over ₹158 crores. The order was later quashed by NCLAT Chennai after the two parties agreed to a settlement. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byju%27s)"}

Ltd, a company which was established by Byju Raveendran, Divya Gokulnath and a group of students in 2011. Byju, an engineer by profession, was coaching students in mathematics since 2006. During the initial days, the company focused on offering online video-based learning programs for the K-12 segment and for competitive exams.

In January 2022, the company joined Simplilearn, Unacademy, upGrad, PrepInsta Prime and Vedantu to become one of the founding members of IAMAI's India EdTech Consortium. In March 2022, it signed a contract with Qatar Investment Authority to establish a new edtech company and an R&D centre in Doha. In August 2022, Bloomberg News reported that India's Ministry of Corporate Affairs sent a letter to Byju's asking them to explain the non-filing of its audited financials for the year ending March 2021. Byju's reasoned that the 17-month delay was due to the challenge of consolidating the accounts of its acquisitions during that year. In spite of the delay, Deloitte gave the company a clean audit. In November 2022, many employees of Byju's came out to speak against the company's unfair treatment. Reportedly, Byju's sacked over 5,000 employees. In April 2023, the Enforcement Directorate announced that it had conducted searches at Byju's offices under the Foreign Exchange Management Act and seized \"incriminating\" documents. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byju%27s)"}

Byju's was the first company in Asia to receive an investment from Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative (co-funded by Meta Platforms co founder, chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan). As per the company filings with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Byju's became a unicorn and was valued at ₹6,505 crore ($1 billion) as of March 2018. In June 2020, Byju's attained the decacorn status with an investment by Mary Meeker's Bond Capital. In March 2022 Byju's raised $800 million, reaching a valuation of $22 billion. In September 2020, Byju's replaced Oppo as the title sponsor of the India national cricket team. Byju's operates roughly on a premium business model where a paid subscription is required for most of the content. In 2017, Byju's generated revenues of about ₹260 crore (US$40 million or €33 million) and doubled it in 2018 financial year, earning ₹520 crore. In June 2020, with the investment of Bond, a global technology investment firm, Byju's became viewed as a decacorn with a US$10.5 billion valuation. In November 2020, Byju's became the title sponsor of the Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters FC replacing Muthoot Group.

In March 2022, the company raised $800 million from Byju Raveendran, Sumeru Ventures, Vitruvian Partners, and BlackRock. In March 2022, Byju's was named as one of the official sponsors of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In 2022 Byjus laid off nearly 4000 people from its team amid funding crunch and road to profitability. Byju's is experiencing a severe funding crunch as of December 2023. The business is at odds with US lenders over unpaid interest on a $1.2 billion term loan. Byju's listed two important assets for sale in an effort to raise between $800 million and $1 billion to help with its financial difficulties. Byju's laid off almost 4,000 employees in 2022 as a result of a lack of funding, hoping to shift toward profitability. In addition, the business is dealing with litigation and grievances regarding its products, services, and business practices from clients, employees, and competitors. Byju Raveendran, the company's founder and group CEO, stated in November 2023 that the business will keep growing profitably and sustainably in the upcoming years. On 25 January 2024, lenders began bankruptcy proceedings against Byju's in an effort to repay its loans. On 1 February 2024, Byju's U.S. division filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. Byju's would raise around $200 million in an effort to clear \"immediate liabilities\" and for other operational costs at a post-money valuation of $225 million. On 22 May 2024, a US bankruptcy court penalized Byju's director Riju Ravindran for contempt of court for refusing to disclose the location of $533 million in loan proceeds. The court also prohibited further transfers of these funds and found co-founders Byju Raveendran and Divya Gokulnath complicit. This decision followed a year-long legal battle between Byju's parent company, Think & Learn, and its bondholders. On 1 August 2024, Byju's director Riju Ravindran was ordered by a US bankruptcy judge to pay $10,000 a day until he helped locate the $533 million the company was accused of hiding from its U.S lenders. In July 2024, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) appointed an Insolvency Resolution Professional to oversee Byju’s day-to-day affairs. This came after BCCI sought initiation of the insolvency proceedings against Byju’s over unpaid dues of Rs.158 crore. The order was later quashed by NCLAT Chennai after the two parties agreed to a settlement. On October 23, 2023, the Supreme Court of India set aside an NCLAT judgment that had closed insolvency proceedings against Byju's parent company, Think & Learn. The case was initiated by US-based creditor Glas Trust over a ₹158 crore debt. The Court ruled that proper procedures were not followed by NCLAT and directed that funds in escrow be moved to the Committee of Creditors. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byju%27s)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Byju's.", "instruction": "Explain Accounting practices", "response": "Byju's subsidiary WhiteHat Jr. was asked to remove their five TV advertisements by the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) due to misleading advertisements and hard sales tactics. WhiteHat Jr. claimed that a child named \"Wolf Gupta\" bagged job offers worth millions of rupees in multiple social media advertisements. This child was often described to be between the ages of 6 and 14 years. Investigations later revealed that this was all fabricated and Mr. \"Gupta\" is a work of fiction. The company had filed a ₹20,000,000 (equivalent to ₹24 million or US$280,000 in 2023) defamation suit against Pradeep Poonia in November 2020, a software engineer, who alleged that the company made false claims and hired incompetent teachers. It was later withdrawn. It has also been the subject of a data leak, where the personal information of over 200,000 users was exposed. Byju's offered a trial period with a 100% down payment refund. The company helped parents purchase expensive courses through easy loans from partner lenders. While Byju's receives the full fee upfront, parents must continue paying EMIs via direct debit, and the subscription is not canceled even if they are dissatisfied with the course or teachers. The Department of Consumer Affairs voiced concerns on 24 June 2022, at India Edtech Consortium (IEC) meeting regarding aggressive sales practices and deceptive marketing strategies utilized by EdTech companies, particularly Byju's and the entities that make up its group. DCA advised Byju's to work closely with the ASCI based on the complaints against it.

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Byju's.", "instruction": "Explain Criminal allegations", "response": "Previously, BYJU's used a different revenue recognition practice, which they had to change and obtain approval in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind-AS) 115 guidelines. For example, revenue expected in one fiscal year for a multi-year charge cannot be considered as revenue in that year alone. This discrepancy was eventually flagged by the auditor and a change was sought by the latter. As of September 2022, BYJU's began recognising streaming revenue across the term of usage, which was previously recognised fully upon the start of the contract. These new accounting standards have resulted in a reduction in the amount of income that Byju's is able to book in advance. Also, in the past, BYJU's used its funding capital to acquire both domestic and overseas businesses and group them under its brand.
