The purpose of screening is early cancer detection, to make the cancer easier to treat and extending life expectancy. In 2019, cancer was the second leading cause of death globally; more recent data is pending due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Universal screening, also known as mass screening or population screening, involves the screening of individuals within certain age and gender groups, aiming to screen the population for particular cancers or cancer risk factors. Selective screening, also known as targeted screening, identifies individuals with a higher risk of developing cancer, including individuals with a family history (genetic risk) of cancer or individuals engaging in high-risk behaviors such as smoking. The act of cancer screening plays a pivotal role in both preventing cancer and providing early diagnosis, contributing to increased success rates in treatment and ultimately extending life expectancy. Controversy arises when it is not clear if the benefits of the screening outweigh the risks associated with the screening procedure, as well as the subsequent diagnostic tests and cancer treatments. Cancer screening is susceptible to producing both false negative and false positive results, underlining the importance of considering the possible errors in the screening process. Additionally, cancer screening can lead to overtreatment if the screening identifies a tumor that is ultimately benign (non-cancerous).\n\n23andMe Holding Co. is an American personal genomics and biotechnology company based in South San Francisco, California. It is best known for providing a direct-to-consumer genetic testing service in which customers provide a saliva sample that is laboratory analysed, using single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, to generate reports relating to the customer's ancestry and genetic predispositions to health-related topics. The company's name is derived from the 23 pairs of chromosomes in a diploid human cell. Founded in 2006, 23andMe soon became the first company to begin offering autosomal DNA testing for ancestry, which all other major companies now use. Its saliva-based direct-to-consumer genetic testing business was named \"Invention of the Year\" by Time in 2008. The company had a previously fraught relationship with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) due to its genetic health tests; as of October 2015, DNA tests ordered in the US include a revised health component, per FDA approval. 23andMe has been selling a product with both ancestry and health-related components in Canada since October 2014, and in the UK since December 2014. 23andMe became a publicly traded company in 2021, via a merger with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), and soon had a market capitalization of US$6 billion. By 2024, its valuation had fallen to 2% of that peak. In March 2025, 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and CEO Anne Wojcicki resigned. Due to sensitive nature of data stored by 23andMe and privacy concerns due to bankruptcy filing, the attorney general of California subsequently issued a consumer alert for its customers.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"
