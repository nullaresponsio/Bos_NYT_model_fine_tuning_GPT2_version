  "assistant": "Connective tissue diseases (also termed connective tissue disorders, or collagen vascular diseases), are medical conditions that affect connective tissue. Connective tissues protect, support, and provide structure for the body's other tissues and structures. They hold the body's structures together. Connective tissues consist of two distinct proteins: elastin and collagen. Tendons, ligaments, skin, cartilage, bone, and blood vessels are all made of collagen. Skin and ligaments also contain elastin. These proteins and the surrounding tissues may suffer damage when the connective tissues become inflamed. The two main categories of connective tissue diseases are (1) a set of relatively rare genetic disorders affecting the primary structure of connective tissue, and (2) a variety of acquired diseases where the connective tissues are the site of multiple, more or less distinct immunological and inflammatory reactions. Diseases in which inflammation or weakness of collagen tends to occur are also referred to as collagen diseases. Collagen vascular diseases can be (but are not necessarily) associated with collagen and blood vessel abnormalities that are autoimmune in nature. Some connective tissue diseases have strong or weak genetic inheritance risks. Others may be due to environmental factors, or a combination of genetic and environmental influences.\n\nATP2A2 also known as sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2) is an ATPase associated with Darier's disease and Acrokeratosis verruciformis. This gene encodes one of the SERCA Ca(2+)-ATPases, which are intracellular pumps located in the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticula of muscle cells. This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP coupled with the translocation of calcium from the cytosol to the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen, and is involved in calcium sequestration associated with muscular excitation and contraction. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connective_tissue_disease"
