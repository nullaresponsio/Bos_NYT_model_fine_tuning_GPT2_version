  "assistant": "Estrogen (also spelled oestrogen in British English; see spelling differences) is a category of sex hormone responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. There are three major endogenous estrogens that have estrogenic hormonal activity: estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). Estradiol, an estrane, is the most potent and prevalent. Another estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. Estrogens are synthesized in all vertebrates and some insects. Quantitatively, estrogens circulate at lower levels than androgens in both men and women. While estrogen levels are significantly lower in males than in females, estrogens nevertheless have important physiological roles in males. Like all steroid hormones, estrogens readily diffuse across the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, they bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ERs) which in turn modulate the expression of many genes. Additionally, estrogens bind to and activate rapid-signaling membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), such as GPER (GPR30). In addition to their role as natural hormones, estrogens are used as medications, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy, hormonal birth control and feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women, intersex people, and nonbinary people. Synthetic and natural estrogens have been found in the environment and are referred to as xenoestrogens. Estrogens are among the wide range of endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) and can cause health issues and reproductive disfunction in both wildlife and humans.\n\n(R,R)-Tetrahydrochrysene ((R,R)-THC) is a drug used to study the estrogen receptors (ERs) in scientific research. It is an ERβ antagonist and an ERα agonist with 10-fold higher affinity for ERβ relative to ERα. (R,R)-THC is a silent antagonist of ERβ, and, uniquely relative to other known ERβ antagonists, a passive antagonist of the receptor. (S,S)-Tetrahydrochrysene ((S,S)-THC) also binds to the ERs, but in contrast to (R,R)-THC, (S,S)-THC is an agonist of both ERα and ERβ and has 20-fold lower affinity for ERβ relative to (R,R)-THC.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen"
