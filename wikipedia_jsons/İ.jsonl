{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on İ.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "İ, or i, called dotted I or i-dot, is a letter used in the Latin-script alphabets of Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, Gagauz, Kazakh, Tatar, and Turkish. It commonly represents the close front unrounded vowel /i/ except in Kazakh in which it additionally represents the voiced palatal approximant /j/ and the diphthongs /ɪj/ and /əj/. All languages that use it also use its dotless counterpart I, but not the basic Latin letter I. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on İ.", "instruction": "Explain Issues", "response": "The dotted I is encoded into Unicode with the code point U+0130 (U+0069 for the lowercase letter) as part of the Latin Extended-A block. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on İ.", "instruction": "Explain Usage in other languages", "response": "The dotted and dotless I characters have caused issues in computing. Languages like Turkish have four variants of the letter I (opposed to two in English). This causes problems when, instead of the original mapping of i to I, Turkish maps i to the new İ, and ı to I, frequently breaking software logic. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on İ.", "instruction": "Explain See also", "response": "Both the dotted and dotless I can be used in transcriptions of Rusyn to allow distinguishing between the letters Ы and И, which would otherwise be both transcribed as \"y\", despite representing different phonemes. Under such transcription the dotted İ would represent the Cyrillic І, and the dotless I would represent either Ы or И, with the other being represented by \"Y\". <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0)"}
