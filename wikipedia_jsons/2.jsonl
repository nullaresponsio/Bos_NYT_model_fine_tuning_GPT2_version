{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on 2.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "2 (two) is a number, numeral and digit. It is the natural number following 1 and preceding 3. It is the smallest and the only even prime number. Because it forms the basis of a duality, it has religious and spiritual significance in many cultures. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on 2.", "instruction": "Explain Etymology of two", "response": "Two is most commonly a determiner used with plural countable nouns, as in two days or I'll take these two. Two is a noun when it refers to the number two as in two plus two is four. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on 2.", "instruction": "Explain Mathematics", "response": "The word two is derived from the Old English words twā (feminine), tū (neuter), and twēġen (masculine, which survives today in the form twain). The pronunciation /tuː/, like that of who, is due to the labialization of the vowel by the w, which then disappeared before the related sound. The successive stages of pronunciation for the Old English twā would thus be /twɑː/, /twɔː/, /twoː/, /twuː/, and finally /tuː/. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on 2.", "instruction": "Explain Geometry", "response": "An integer is determined to be even if it is divisible by two. When written in base 10, all multiples of 2 will end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8; more generally, in any even base, even numbers will end with an even digit. 2 is the smallest and the only even prime number, and the first Ramanujan prime. It is also the first superior highly composite number, and the first colossally abundant number. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on 2.", "instruction": "Explain In science", "response": "The digit used in the modern Western world to represent the number 2 traces its roots back to the Indic Brahmic script, where \"2\" was written as two horizontal lines. The modern Chinese and Japanese languages (and Korean Hanja) still use this method. The Gupta script rotated the two lines 45 degrees, making them diagonal. The top line was sometimes also shortened and had its bottom end curve towards the center of the bottom line. In the Nagari script, the top line was written more like a curve connecting to the bottom line. In the Arabic Ghubar writing, the bottom line was completely vertical, and the digit looked like a dotless closing question mark. Restoring the bottom line to its original horizontal position, but keeping the top line as a curve that connects to the bottom line leads to our modern digit. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2)"}
