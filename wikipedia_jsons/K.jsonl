{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on K.", "instruction": "Explain Use in writing systems", "response": "The letter K comes from the Greek letter Œö (kappa), which was taken from the Semitic kaph, the symbol for an open hand. This, in turn, was likely adapted by Semitic tribes who had lived in Egypt from the hieroglyph for \"hand\" representing /·∏è/ in the Egyptian word for hand, ‚ü®·∏è-r-t‚ü© (likely pronounced /Ààc ºaÀê…æat/ in Old Egyptian). The Semites evidently assigned it the sound value /k/ instead, because their word for hand started with that sound. K was brought into the Latin alphabet with the name ka /kaÀê/ to differentiate it from C, named ce (pronounced /keÀê/) and Q, named qu and pronounced /kuÀê/. In the earliest Latin inscriptions, the letters C, K and Q were all used to represent the sounds /k/ and /…°/ (which were not differentiated in writing). Of these, Q was used before a rounded vowel (e.g. ‚ü®EQO‚ü© 'ego'), K before /a/ (e.g. ‚ü®KALENDIS‚ü© 'calendis'), and C elsewhere. Later, the use of C and its variant G replaced most usages of K and Q. K survived only in a few fossilized forms, such as Kalendae, \"the calends\". After Greek words were taken into Latin, the kappa was transliterated as a C. Loanwords from other alphabets with the sound /k/ were also transliterated with C. Hence, the Romance languages generally use C, in imitating Classical Latin's practice, and have K only in later loanwords from other language groups. The Celtic languages also tended to use C instead of K, and this influence carried over into Old English. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K)"}

Like J, X, Q, and Z, the letter K is not used very frequently in English.

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on K.", "instruction": "Explain Other systems", "response": "In most languages where it is employed, this letter represents the sound /k/ (with or without aspiration) or some similar sound. The Latinization of Modern Greek also uses this letter for /k/. However, before the front vowels (/e, i/), this is rendered as [c], which can be considered a separate phoneme. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K)"}
