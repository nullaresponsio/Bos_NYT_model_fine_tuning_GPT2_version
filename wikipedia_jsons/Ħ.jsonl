{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ħ.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "Ħ (minuscule: ħ) is a letter of the Latin alphabet, derived from H with the addition of a bar. It is used in Maltese for a voiceless pharyngeal fricative consonant (corresponding to the letter heth of Semitic abjads: Arabic: ح, Hebrew: ח). Lowercase ħ is used in the International Phonetic Alphabet for the same sound. The lowercase resembles the Cyrillic letter Tshe (ћ), or the astronomical symbol of Saturn (♄), later used in the alchemical symbol representing lead. A white uppercase Ħ on a red square was the logo of Heritage Malta until 2022. It is used as the symbol for Hedera Hashgraph's native cryptocurrency, HBAR. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H_with_stroke_(%C4%A6))"}
