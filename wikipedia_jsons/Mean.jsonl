{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Mean.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "A mean is a quantity representing the \"center\" of a collection of numbers and is intermediate to the extreme values of the set of numbers. There are several kinds of means (or \"measures of central tendency\") in mathematics, especially in statistics. Each attempts to summarize or typify a given group of data, illustrating the magnitude and sign of the data set. Which of these measures is most illuminating depends on what is being measured, and on context and purpose. The arithmetic mean, also known as \"arithmetic average\", is the sum of the values divided by the number of values. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn is typically denoted using an overhead bar, x ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}} . If the numbers are from observing a sample of a larger group, the arithmetic mean is termed the sample mean ( x ¯ {\\displaystyle {\\bar {x}}} ) to distinguish it from the group mean (or expected value) of the underlying distribution, denoted μ {\\displaystyle \\mu } or μ x {\\displaystyle \\mu _{x}} . Outside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of mean are often used in geometry and mathematical analysis; examples are given below. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Mean.", "instruction": "Explain Mean of a probability distribution", "response": "In descriptive statistics, the mean may be confused with the median, mode or mid-range, as any of these may incorrectly be called an \"average\" (more formally, a measure of central tendency). The mean of a set of observations is the arithmetic average of the values; however, for skewed distributions, the mean is not necessarily the same as the middle value (median), or the most likely value (mode). For example, mean income is typically skewed upwards by a small number of people with very large incomes, so that the majority have an income lower than the mean. By contrast, the median income is the level at which half the population is below and half is above. The mode income is the most likely income and favors the larger number of people with lower incomes. While the median and mode are often more intuitive measures for such skewed data, many skewed distributions are in fact best described by their mean, including the exponential and Poisson distributions. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Mean.", "instruction": "Explain Generalized means", "response": "The mean of a probability distribution is the long-run arithmetic average value of a random variable having that distribution. If the random variable is denoted by X {\\displaystyle X} , then the mean is also known as the expected value of X {\\displaystyle X} (denoted E ( X ) {\\displaystyle E(X)} ). For a discrete probability distribution, the mean is given by ∑ x P ( x ) {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\sum xP(x)} , where the sum is taken over all possible values of the random variable and P ( x ) {\\displaystyle P(x)} is the probability mass function. For a continuous distribution, the mean is ∫ − ∞ ∞ x f ( x ) d x {\\displaystyle \\textstyle \\int _{-\\infty }^{\\infty }xf(x)\\,dx} , where f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} is the probability density function. In all cases, including those in which the distribution is neither discrete nor continuous, the mean is the Lebesgue integral of the random variable with respect to its probability measure. The mean need not exist or be finite; for some probability distributions the mean is infinite (+∞ or −∞), while for others the mean is undefined. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Mean.", "instruction": "Explain Mean of angles and cyclical quantities", "response": "In some circumstances, mathematicians may calculate a mean of an infinite (or even an uncountable) set of values. This can happen when calculating the mean value y avg {\\displaystyle y_{\\text{avg}}} of a function f ( x ) {\\displaystyle f(x)} . Intuitively, a mean of a function can be thought of as calculating the area under a section of a curve, and then dividing by the length of that section. This can be done crudely by counting squares on graph paper, or more precisely by integration. The integration formula is written as: y avg ( a , b ) = 1 b − a ∫ a b f ( x ) d x {\\displaystyle y_{\\text{avg}}(a,b)={\\frac {1}{b-a}}\\int \\limits _{a}^{b}\\!f(x)\\,dx} In this case, care must be taken to make sure that the integral converges.
