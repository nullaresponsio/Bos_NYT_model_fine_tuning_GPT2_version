  "assistant": "A bronchus ( BRONG-k…ôs; pl.: bronchi, BRONG-ky) is a passage or airway in the lower respiratory tract that conducts air into the lungs. The first or primary bronchi to branch from the trachea at the carina are the right main bronchus and the left main bronchus. These are the widest bronchi, and enter the right lung, and the left lung at each hilum. The main bronchi branch into narrower secondary bronchi or lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi or segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the segmental bronchi are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi. The bronchi, when too narrow to be supported by cartilage, are known as bronchioles. No gas exchange takes place in the bronchi.\n\nIn medicine, describing a disease as acute denotes that it is of recent onset; it occasionally denotes a short duration. The quantification of how much time constitutes \"short\" and \"recent\" varies by disease and by context, but the core denotation of \"acute\" is always qualitatively in contrast with \"chronic\", which denotes long-lasting disease (for example, in acute leukaemia and chronic leukaemia). In the context of the mass noun \"acute disease\", it refers to the acute phase (that is, a short course) of any disease entity. For example, in an article on ulcerative enteritis in poultry, the author says, \"in acute disease there may be increased mortality without any obvious signs\", referring to the acute form or phase of ulcerative enteritis.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchus"
