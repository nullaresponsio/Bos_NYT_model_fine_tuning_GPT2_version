{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Đ.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "Đ (lowercase: đ, Latin alphabet), known as crossed D or dyet, is a letter formed from the base character D/d overlaid with a crossbar. Crossing was used to create eth (ð), but eth has an uncial as its base whereas đ is based on the straight-backed roman d, like in the Sámi languages and Vietnamese. Crossed d is a letter in the alphabets of several languages and is used in linguistics as a voiced dental fricative. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_with_stroke)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Đ.", "instruction": "Explain Uses by language", "response": "In the lowercase, the crossbar is usually drawn through the ascender, but when used as a phonetic symbol it may be preferred to draw it through the bowl, in which case it is known as a barred d. In some African languages' orthographies, such as that of Moro, the barred d is preferred. In the uppercase, the crossbar normally crosses just the left stem, but in Vietnamese and Moro it may sometimes cross the entire letter. The DE ligature should not be confused with the Đ. That ligature was used stylistically in pre-19th century Spanish as a contraction for de, as a D with an E superimposed. For example, Universidad DE Guadalajara. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_with_stroke)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Đ.", "instruction": "Explain Sámi languages", "response": "The letter Đ/đ is used to write the voiced alveolo-palatal affricate, [dʑ], similar to the ⟨j⟩ in \"jam\". The crossed d was introduced by the Serbian philologist Đuro Daničić in 1878 for use in Serbo-Croatian in his Dictionary of the Croatian or Serbian Language, replacing the older digraphs dj and gj. Daničić modeled the letter after the Icelandic and Anglo-Saxon letter eth, albeit representing a different sound. In 1892 it was officially introduced in Croatian and Slavonian schools (in the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia where the Croatian language was official) and so definitively added to Gaj’s Latin alphabet. The letter thereafter gradually entered daily use, spreading throughout Serbo-Croatian and then to Macedonian (its Latin transliterations are heavily influenced by Serbo-Croatian from the Yugoslav period). The crossed d is today considered a distinct letter, and is placed between Dž and E in alphabetical order. Its Cyrillic equivalent is Ђ ђ. Its partial equivalent in Macedonian is Ѓ ѓ (because only some dialects contain the /dʑ/ sound). When a true đ is not available or desired, it is transcribed as dj in modern Serbo-Croatian, and as gj in Macedonian. The use of dj in place of đ used to be more common in Serbo-Croatian texts, but it is falling out of practice. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_with_stroke)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Đ.", "instruction": "Explain Spanish", "response": "Đ is the seventh letter of the Vietnamese alphabet, after D and before E. Traditionally, digraphs and trigraphs like CH and NGH were considered letters as well, making Đ the eighth letter. Đ is a letter in its own right, rather than a ligature or letter-diacritic combination; therefore, đá would come after dù in any alphabetical listing. Đ represents a voiced alveolar implosive (/ɗ/) or, according to Thompson (1959), a preglottalized voiced alveolar stop (/ʔd/). Whereas D is pronounced as some sort of dental or alveolar stop in most Latin alphabets, an unadorned D in Vietnamese represents either /z/ (Hanoian) or /j/ (Saigonese). The Vietnamese alphabet was formally described for the first time in the 17th-century text Manuductio ad Linguam Tunckinensem, attributed to a Portuguese Jesuit missionary, possibly Francisco de Pina or Filipe Sibin. This passage about the letter Đ was later incorporated into Alexandre de Rhodes' seminal Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum: Another letter written with the symbol đ is completely different than our own and is pronounced by raising the tip of the tongue to the palate of the mouth, immediately removing it, without in any way touching the teeth, for example đa đa: partridge. And this letter is very commonly used at the beginning of a word. On older typewriters, Đ was located where Z would be in the French AZERTY layout. Alternatively, a hyphen can be overstruck onto a D. On computers without support for a Vietnamese character set or Unicode, Đ is encoded as DD and đ as dd according to the Vietnamese Quoted-Readable standard. Vietnamese computer users typically input Đ as DD in the Telex and VIQR input methods or as D9 in the VNI input method. In the absence of an input method, the TCVN 6064:1995 and Microsoft Windows Vietnamese keyboard layouts map ZA0-09 (0 on a U.S. keyboard) to đ, or Đ when holding down ⇧ Shift. The Windows layout also maps ZA0-11 (=) to ₫. Other modes of communication also have dedicated representations of Đ. In Vietnamese Braille, it is ⠙, which corresponds to D in French Braille. In the Vietnamese manual alphabet, Đ is produced by touching the thumb to the index finger. In Morse code, it is rendered – · · – · ·, corresponding to Telex's \"DD\". <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_with_stroke)"}
