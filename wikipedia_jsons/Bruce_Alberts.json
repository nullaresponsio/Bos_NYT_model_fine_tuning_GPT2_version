  "assistant": "Bruce Michael Alberts (born April 14, 1938, in Chicago, Illinois) is an American biochemist and the Emeritus Chancellor’s Leadership Chair in Biochemistry and Biophysics for Science and Education at the University of California, San Francisco. He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the \"canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook\" Molecular Biology of the Cell, and served as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine. He was awarded the National Medal of Science for \"intellectual leadership and experimental innovation in the field of DNA replication, and for unparalleled dedication to improving science education and promoting science-based public policy\" in 2014. Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005. He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia. He has stated that \"Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist—insisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements.\" He is an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund's College, Cambridge.\n\nAnthony Edward Walsby, FRS (died April 14, 2024) was a Professor of Microbiology at the School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol. He was a researcher in the fields of Algae, Cyanobacteria, lake ecology, gas vesicles and genetics, covering the European lakes and Baltic Sea. He is noted for his discovery of Haloquadratum walsbyi in brine ponds on the Sinai Peninsula in 1980. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, 11 March 1993. Specifically his research included: Gas vesicles of cyanobacteria: physiology; structure; molecular biology; ecology The natural selection of gas vesicles in relation to depth of lakes and oceans Population genetics of cyanobacteria using PCR on single filaments from lakes The cyanobacterium Planktothrix rubescens in stratified lakes Calculating the daily integrals of growth and photosynthesis in lakes\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Alberts"
