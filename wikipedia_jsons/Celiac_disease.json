  "assistant": "Coeliac disease (British English) or celiac disease (American English) is a long-term autoimmune disorder, primarily affecting the small intestine. Patients develop intolerance to gluten, which is present in foods such as wheat, rye, spelt and barley. Classic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distention, malabsorption, loss of appetite, and among children failure to grow normally. Non-classic symptoms are more common, especially in people older than two years. There may be mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms, a wide number of symptoms involving any part of the body, or no obvious symptoms. Due to the frequency of these symptoms, coeliac disease is often considered a systemic disease, rather than a gastrointestinal condition. Coeliac disease was first described as a disease which initially presents during childhood; however, it may develop at any age. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as Type 1 diabetes mellitus and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, among others. Coeliac disease is caused by a reaction to gluten, a group of various proteins found in wheat and in other grains such as barley and rye. Moderate quantities of oats, free of contamination with other gluten-containing grains, are usually tolerated. The occurrence of problems may depend on the variety of oat. It occurs more often in people who are genetically predisposed. Upon exposure to gluten, an abnormal immune response may lead to the production of several different autoantibodies that can affect a number of different organs. In the small bowel, this causes an inflammatory reaction and may produce shortening of the villi lining the small intestine (villous atrophy). This affects the absorption of nutrients, frequently leading to anaemia. Diagnosis is typically made by a combination of blood antibody tests and intestinal biopsies, helped by specific genetic testing. Making the diagnosis is not always straightforward. About 10% of the time, the autoantibodies in the blood are negative, and many people have only minor intestinal changes with normal villi. People may have severe symptoms and they may be investigated for years before a diagnosis is achieved. As a result of screening, the diagnosis is increasingly being made in people who have no symptoms. Evidence regarding the effects of screening, however, is currently insufficient to determine its usefulness. While the disease is caused by a permanent intolerance to gluten proteins, it is distinct from wheat allergy, which is much more rare. The only known effective treatment is a strict lifelong gluten-free diet, which leads to recovery of the intestinal lining (mucous membrane), improves symptoms, and reduces the risk of developing complications in most people. If untreated, it may result in cancers such as intestinal lymphoma, and a slightly increased risk of early death. Rates vary between different regions of the world, from as few as 1 in 300 to as many as 1 in 40, with an average of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 170 people. It is estimated that 80% of cases remain undiagnosed, usually because of minimal or absent gastrointestinal complaints and lack of knowledge of symptoms and diagnostic criteria. Coeliac disease is slightly more common in women than in men.\n\nAbdominal angina is abdominal pain after eating caused by a reduction of blood flow to the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric arteries (SMA), inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), or the surrounding organs. Symptoms include abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and an aversion or fear of eating caused by the pain associated with eating. Abdominal angina is caused by obstruction or stenosis of the inferior mesenteric artery, celiac trunk, or superior mesenteric artery. Gender, age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia are risk factors for abdominal angina. The digestive tract relies on the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric arteries for blood flow. Abdominal pain occurs when these arteries fail to provide adequate blood flow. Abdominal angina is diagnosed using imaging to identify stenosis. Differential diagnoses include GERD, dietary sensitivities, constipation, pancreatitis, abdominal abscess, appendicitis, irritable bowel syndrome, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, and gastrointestinal system inflammation. Chronic mesenteric ischemia requires surgical revascularization and treatment like stents, transaortic endarterectomy, or bypassing the arteries. Abdominal angina often has a one-year delay between symptoms and treatment, leading to complications like malnutrition or bowel infarction. Abdominal angina is more prevalent in females with a 3:1 ratio, and the average age of onset is 60 years. Abdominal angina was first described by Dr. Baccelli in 1918 as lower abdominal pain after eating.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease"
