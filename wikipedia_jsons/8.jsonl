{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on 8.", "instruction": "Explain Evolution of the Arabic digit", "response": "English eight, from Old English eahta, æhta, Proto-Germanic *ahto is a direct continuation of Proto-Indo-European *oḱtṓ(w)-, and as such cognate with Greek ὀκτώ and Latin octo-, both of which stems are reflected by the English prefix oct(o)-, as in the ordinal adjective octaval or octavary, the distributive adjective is octonary. The adjective octuple (Latin octu-plus) may also be used as a noun, meaning \"a set of eight items\"; the diminutive octuplet is mostly used to refer to eight siblings delivered in one birth. The Semitic numeral is based on a root *θmn-, whence Akkadian smn-, Arabic ṯmn-, Hebrew šmn- etc. The Chinese numeral, written 八 (Mandarin: bā; Cantonese: baat), is from Old Chinese *priāt-, ultimately from Sino-Tibetan b-r-gyat or b-g-ryat which also yielded Tibetan brgyat. It has been argued that, as the cardinal number 7 is the highest number of items that can universally be cognitively processed as a single set, the etymology of the numeral eight might be the first to be considered composite, either as \"twice four\" or as \"two short of ten\", or similar. The Turkic words for \"eight\" are from a Proto-Turkic stem *sekiz, which has been suggested as originating as a negation of eki \"two\", as in \"without two fingers\" (i.e., \"two short of ten; two fingers are not being held up\"); this same principle is found in Finnic *kakte-ksa, which conveys a meaning of \"two before (ten)\". The Proto-Indo-European reconstruction *oḱtṓ(w)- itself has been argued as representing an old dual, which would correspond to an original meaning of \"twice four\". Proponents of this \"quaternary hypothesis\" adduce the numeral 9, which might be built on the stem new-, meaning \"new\" (indicating the beginning of a \"new set of numerals\" after having counted to eight). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on 8.", "instruction": "Explain In mathematics", "response": "The modern digit 8, like all modern Arabic numerals other than zero, originates with the Brahmi numerals. The Brahmi digit for eight by the 1st century was written in one stroke as a curve └┐ looking like an uppercase H with the bottom half of the left line and the upper half of the right line removed. However, the digit for eight used in India in the early centuries of the Common Era developed considerable graphic variation, and in some cases took the shape of a single wedge, which was adopted into the Perso-Arabic tradition as ٨ (and also gave rise to the later Devanagari form ८); the alternative curved glyph also existed as a variant in Perso-Arabic tradition, where it came to look similar to our digit 5. The digits as used in Al-Andalus by the 10th century were a distinctive western variant of the glyphs used in the Arabic-speaking world, known as ghubār numerals (ghubār translating to \"sand table\"). In these digits, the line of the 5-like glyph used in Indian manuscripts for eight came to be formed in ghubār as a closed loop, which was the 8-shape that became adopted into European use in the 10th century. Just as in most modern typefaces, in typefaces with text figures the character for the digit 8 usually has an ascender, as, for example, in . The infinity symbol ∞, described as a \"sideways figure eight\", is unrelated to the digit 8 in origin; it is first used (in the mathematical meaning \"infinity\") in the 17th century, and it may be derived from the Roman numeral for \"one thousand\" CIƆ, or alternatively from the final Greek letter, ω. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8)"}

A regular octagon can fill a plane-vertex with a regular triangle and a regular icositetragon, as well as tessellate two-dimensional space alongside squares in the truncated square tiling. This tiling is one of eight Archimedean tilings that are semi-regular, or made of more than one type of regular polygon, and the only tiling that can admit a regular octagon. The Ammann–Beenker tiling is a nonperiodic tesselation of prototiles that feature prominent octagonal silver eightfold symmetry, that is the two-dimensional orthographic projection of the four-dimensional 8-8 duoprism. An octahedron is a regular polyhedron with eight equilateral triangles as faces. is the dual polyhedron to the cube and one of eight convex deltahedra. The stella octangula, or eight-pointed star, is the only stellation with octahedral symmetry. It has eight triangular faces alongside eight vertices that forms a cubic faceting, composed of two self-dual tetrahedra that makes it the simplest of five regular compounds. The cuboctahedron, on the other hand, is a rectified cube or rectified octahedron, and one of only two convex quasiregular polyhedra. It contains eight equilateral triangular faces, whose first stellation is the cube-octahedron compound. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on 8.", "instruction": "Explain In astrology", "response": "The number eight is considered to be a lucky number in Chinese and other Asian cultures. Eight (八; accounting 捌; pinyin bā) is considered a lucky number in Chinese culture because it sounds like the word meaning to generate wealth (發(T) 发(S); Pinyin: fā). Property with the number 8 may be valued greatly by Chinese. For example, a Hong Kong number plate with the number 8 was sold for $640,000. The opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics in Beijing started at 8 seconds and 8 minutes past 8 p.m. (local time) on 8 August 2008. In Pythagorean numerology the number 8 represents victory, prosperity and overcoming. Eight (八, hachi, ya) is also considered a lucky number in Japan, but the reason is different from that in Chinese culture. Eight gives an idea of growing prosperous, because the letter (八) broadens gradually. The Japanese thought of eight (や, ya) as a holy number in the ancient times. The reason is less well-understood, but it is thought that it is related to the fact they used eight to express large numbers vaguely such as manyfold (やえはたえ, Yae Hatae) (literally, eightfold and twentyfold), many clouds (やくも, Yakumo) (literally, eight clouds), millions and millions of Gods (やおよろずのかみ, Yaoyorozu no Kami) (literally, eight millions of Gods), etc. It is also guessed that the ancient Japanese gave importance to pairs, so some researchers guess twice as four (よ, yo), which is also guessed to be a holy number in those times because it indicates the world (north, south, east, and west) might be considered a very holy number. In numerology, 8 is the number of building, and in some theories, also the number of destruction. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8)"}
