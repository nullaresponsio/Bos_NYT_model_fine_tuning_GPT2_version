  "assistant": "Colibactin is a genotoxic metabolite produced by Escherichia coli and other Enterobacteriaceae (\"enteric bacteria\") believed to cause mutations leading to colorectal cancer and the progression of colorectal cancer, especially in early-onset colorectal cancers. Colibactin is a polyketide peptide that can form interstrand crosslinks in DNA. Colibactin is only produced by bacterial strains containing a polyketide synthase genomic island (pks) or clb biosynthetic gene cluster. About 20% of humans in high-income countries are colonized with E. coli that harbor the pks island. Colibactin forms DNA inter-strand cross-links by alkylation of adenine moieties on opposing DNA strands. It induces lytic development in certain bacteria that contain prophages. Colibactin has been previously demonstrated to have a characteristic mutational signature. The same mutational signature was discovered in several cohorts of colon cancer patients, and in smaller numbers of patients with urogenital and head and neck cancers. Colibactin exposure has been further linked to a proportion of APC driver indels.\n\nAdenine (, ) (symbol A or Ade) is a purine nucleotide base that is found in DNA, RNA, and ATP. Usually a white crystalline subtance. The shape of adenine is complementary and pairs to either thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA. In cells adenine, as an independent molecule, is rare. It is almost always covalently bound to become a part of a larger biomolecule. Adenine has a central role in cellular respiration. It is part of adenosine triphosphate which provides the energy that drives and supports most activities in living cells, such as protein synthesis, chemical synthesis, muscle contraction, and nerve impulse propagation. In respiration it also participates as part of the cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and Coenzyme A. It is also part of adenosine, adenosine monophosphate, cyclic adenosine monophosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and S-adenosylmethionine.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colibactin"
