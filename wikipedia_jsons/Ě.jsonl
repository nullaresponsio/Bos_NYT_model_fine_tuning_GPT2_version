{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ě.", "instruction": "Explain Serbo-Croatian", "response": "The letter ě is a vestige of Old-Czech palatalization. The originally-palatalizing phoneme, yat /ě/ [ʲɛ], became extinct and changed to [ɛ] or [jɛ], but it is preserved as a grapheme. The letter never appears in the initial position, and its pronunciation depends on the preceding consonant: Dě, tě, ně [ɟɛ, cɛ, ɲɛ] is written instead of ďe, ťe, ňe (analogously to di, ti, ni). Bě, pě, vě, fě is written instead of bje, pje, vje, fje. Nevertheless, some words (vjezd, \"entry, drive-in\"; objem, \"volume\") are written with bje, vje because –je- is part of the etymological root of the word, preceded by the prefix v- or ob-. Mě [mɲɛ] is written instead of mňe. For etymological reasons, mně is written in some words (jemný, \"soft\" -> jemně, \"softly\"). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9A)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ě.", "instruction": "Explain Chinese", "response": "The grapheme is sometimes used in Serbo-Croatian to denote a jat (něsam, věra, lěpo, pověst, tělo). It is pronounced in different ways depending on the dialect: Ekavian (nesam, vera, lepo, povest, telo), Ikavian (nisam, vira, lipo, povist, tilo) or Ijekavian (nijesam, vjera, lijepo, povijest, tijelo). Historically its use was very widespread, but it gradually lost favour to combined j and e graphemes and was eventually dropped from the Gaj's Latin alphabet. It is found only in scientific and historically-accurate literature. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%9A)"}
