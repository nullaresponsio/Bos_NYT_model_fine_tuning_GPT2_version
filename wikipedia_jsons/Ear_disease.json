Otology also studies vestibular sensory systems, related structures and functions, as well as their diseases, diagnosis and treatment. Otologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the middle ear and mastoid related to chronic otitis media, such as tympanoplasty (ear drum surgery), ossiculoplasty (surgery of the hearing bones) and mastoidectomy. Otology also includes surgical treatment of conductive hearing loss, such as stapedectomy surgery for otosclerosis. Neurotology (a related field of medicine and subspecialty of otolaryngology) is the study of diseases of the inner ear, which can lead to hearing and balance disorders. Neurotologic surgery generally refers to surgery of the inner ear, or surgery that involves entering the inner ear with risk to the hearing and balance organs, including labyrinthectomy, cochlear implant surgery, and surgery for tumors of the temporal bone, such as intracanalicular acoustic neuromas. Neurotology is expanded to include surgery of the lateral skull base to treat intracranial tumors related to the ear and surrounding nerve and vascular structures, such as large cerebellar pontine angle acoustic neuromas, glomus jugulare tumors and facial nerve tumors. Some of the concerns of otology include: identifying the underlying mechanisms of Ménière's disease, finding the causes of tinnitus and developing treatment methods, and defining the development and progression of otitis media. Related concerns of neurotology include: studying signal processing in the cochlear implant patient, investigating postural control areas and vestibulo-ocular mechanisms, and studying the genetics of acoustic neuromas in patients with neurofibromatosis, to better understanding how to treat these tumors and prevent their growth.\n\nA vestibular schwannoma (VS), also called acoustic neuroma, is a benign tumor that develops on the vestibulocochlear nerve that passes from the inner ear to the brain. The tumor originates when Schwann cells that form the insulating myelin sheath on the nerve malfunction. Normally, Schwann cells function beneficially to protect the nerves which transmit balance and sound information to the brain. However, sometimes a mutation in the tumor suppressor gene, NF2, located on chromosome 22, results in abnormal production of the cell protein named Merlin, and Schwann cells multiply to form a tumor. The tumor originates mostly on the vestibular division of the nerve rather than the cochlear division, but hearing as well as balance will be affected as the tumor enlarges. The great majority of these VSs (95%) are unilateral, in one ear only. They are called \"sporadic\" (i.e., by-chance, non-hereditary). Although non-cancerous, they can do harm or even become life-threatening if they grow to press on other cranial nerves and vital structures such as the brainstem. Variations in the mutation determine the nature of the tumor's development. The only environmental exposure that has been definitely associated with the growth of a VS is therapeutic radiation exposure to the head.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otology"
