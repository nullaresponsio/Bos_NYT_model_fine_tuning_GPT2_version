{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Â.", "instruction": "Explain Friulian", "response": "⟨â⟩, in the French language, is used as the letter ⟨a⟩ with a circumflex accent. It is a remnant of Old French, where the vowel was followed, with some exceptions, by the consonant ⟨s⟩. For example, the modern form bâton (English: stick) comes from the Old French baston. Phonetically, ⟨â⟩ is traditionally pronounced as /ɑ/, but is nowadays rarely distinguished from /a/ in many dialects such as in Parisian French. However, the traditional ⟨â⟩ is still pronounced this way in Québecois French or Canadian French, which is known to resemble the phonetics of the Old French accent, and is widely spoken by French Canadians, the majority of whom live in the province of Québec. In Maghreb French, ⟨â⟩ is used to transcribe the Arabic consonant ⟨ع⟩ /ʕ/, whose pronunciation is close to a non-syllabic [ɑ̯]. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%82)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Â.", "instruction": "Explain Russian", "response": "Â is the 3rd letter of the Romanian alphabet and represents /ɨ/, which is also represented in Romanian as letter î. The difference between the two is that â is used in the middle of the word, as in \"România\", while î is used at the beginning and at the ends: \"înțelegere\" (understanding), \"a urî\" (to hate). A compound word starting with the letter î will retain it, even if it goes in the middle of the word: compare \"înțelegere\" (understanding) with \"neînțelegere\" (misunderstanding). However, if a suffix is added, the î changes into â, as in the example: \"a urî\" (to hate), \"urât\" (hated).

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Â.", "instruction": "Explain In Unicode", "response": "In Welsh, â is used to represent long stressed a [aː] when, without the circumflex, the vowel would be pronounced as short [a], e.g., âr [aːr] \"arable\", as opposed to ar [ar] \"on\"; or gwâr [ɡwaːr] \"civilised, humane\", rather than gwar [ɡwar] \"nape of the neck\". It is often found in final syllables where two adjacent a letters combine to produce a long stressed vowel. This commonly happens when a verb stem ending in stressed a combines with the nominalising suffix -ad, as in caniata- + -ad giving caniatâd [kanjaˈtaːd] \"permission\", and also when a singular noun ending in a receives the plural suffix -au, as in drama + -au becoming dramâu [draˈmaɨ, draˈmai] \"dramas, plays\". It is also useful in writing borrowed words with final stress, e.g. brigâd [brɪˈɡaːd] \"brigade\". A circumflex is also used in the word â, which is both a preposition, meaning \"with, by means of, as\", and the third person non-past singular of the verbal noun mynd, \"go\". This distinguishes it in writing from the similarly pronounced a, meaning \"and; whether; who, which, that\". <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%82)"}

In UTF-8, the copyright symbol (©) is encoded with the hexadecimal bytes C2 A9. In the older Western encoding standards, however, the © symbol is simply A9. If a browser is given the bytes C2 A9, intended to display © in UTF-8, but is led to parse the bytes according to one of the Western encodings, it will interpret the bytes C2 A9 as two separate characters. C2 corresponds to Â, as seen in the chart above, and A9 devolves to the © symbol, so the result seen by the person reading the page is Â©—that is, the correct © symbol but with an Â prepended. Characters with Unicode code points from A0 to BF have UTF-8 encodings that are identical to their Western encodings but preceded by the byte C2, so that when any of these characters is encoded in UTF-8 and viewed in a Western encoding, an Â will appear before it. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%82)"}
