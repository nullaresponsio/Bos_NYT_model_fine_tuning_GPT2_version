It is also related to the Ancient North Arabian 𐪔‎, South Arabian 𐩴, and Ge'ez ገ. Its sound value in the original Phoenician and in all derived alphabets, except Arabic (see below), is a voiced velar plosive [ɡ]; in Modern Standard Arabic, it represents either a /d͡ʒ/ or /ʒ/ for most Arabic speakers except in Northern Egypt, the southern parts of Yemen and some parts of Oman where it is pronounced as the voiced velar plosive [ɡ]. In its Proto-Canaanite form, the letter may have been named after a weapon that was either a staff sling or a throwing stick (spear thrower), ultimately deriving from a Proto-Sinaitic glyph based on the hieroglyph below: The Phoenician letter gave rise to the Greek gamma (Γ), the Latin C, G, Ɣ and Ȝ, and the Cyrillic Г, Ґ, and Ғ. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimel)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ج.", "instruction": "Explain Historical pronunciation", "response": "In all varieties of Arabic, cognate words will have consistent differences in pronunciation of the letter. The standard pronunciation taught outside the Arabic speaking world is an affricate [d͡ʒ], which was the agreed-upon pronunciation by the end of the nineteenth century to recite the Qur'an. It is pronounced as a fricative [ʒ] in most of Northern Africa and the Levant, and [ɡ] is the prestigious and most common pronunciation in Egypt, which is also found in Southern Arabian Peninsula. Differences in pronunciation occur because readers of Modern Standard Arabic pronounce words following their native dialects. Egyptians always use the letter to represent [ɡ] as well as in names and loanwords, such as جولف \"golf\". However, ج may be used in Egypt to transcribe /ʒ~d͡ʒ/ (normally pronounced [ʒ]) or if there is a need to distinguish them completely, then چ is used to represent /ʒ/, which is also a proposal for Mehri and Soqotri languages. The literary standard pronunciations [d͡ʒ]: In most of the Arabian Peninsula, parts of Algeria (Algiers dialect), Iraq, parts of Egypt, parts of the Levant. This is also the commonly taught pronunciation outside the Arabic speaking countries when Literary Arabic is taught as a foreign language. It is the agreed-upon pronunciation to recite the Qur'an and it also corresponds to ġ /d͡ʒ/ in Maltese (a Semitic language derived from Sicilian Arabic) as in ġar (neighbor) and Arabic جار (neighbor) both pronounced [d͡ʒaːr]. [ʒ]: In the Levant (especially in the urban centers), Southern Iraqi Arabic, most of the Maghreb, and parts of Algeria (Oran dialect), and by some speakers in western Saudi Arabia (Hejaz). [g]: In Egypt, coastal Yemen (West and South), southwestern and eastern Oman. [ɟ]: In Sudan, parts of Saudi Arabia, and hinterland Yemen. Non-literary pronunciation [j]: In eastern Arabian Peninsula in the most colloquial speech, though sometimes [d͡ʒ] or [ʒ] in Literary Arabic loan words. [j]: In eastern Arabian Peninsula and Iraq but only colloquial speech, for example Kuwaiti Arabic وايد [waːjɪd] “a lot” vs. Najdi Arabic واجد [waːd͡ʒɪd]. [ɟʝ]: attested among some bedouin dialects in Saudi Arabia. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimel)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ج.", "instruction": "Explain Pronunciation across other languages", "response": "While in most Semitic languages, e.g. Aramaic, Hebrew, Ge'ez, Old South Arabian the equivalent letter represents a [ɡ], Arabic is considered unique among them where the Jīm ⟨ج⟩ was palatalized to an affricate [d͡ʒ] or a fricative [ʒ] in most dialects from classical times. While there is variation in Modern Arabic varieties, most of them reflect this palatalized pronunciation except in coastal Yemeni and Omani dialects as well as in Egypt, where it is pronounced [g]. It is not well known when palatalization occurred or the probability of it being connected to the pronunciation of Qāf ⟨ق⟩ as a [ɡ], but in most of the Arabian peninsula (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, UAE and parts of Yemen and Oman), the ⟨ج⟩ represents a [d͡ʒ] and ⟨ق⟩ represents a [ɡ], except in coastal Yemen and southern Oman where ⟨ج⟩ represents a [ɡ] and ⟨ق⟩ represents a [q], which shows a strong correlation between the palatalization of ⟨ج⟩ to [d͡ʒ] and the pronunciation of the ⟨ق⟩ as a [ɡ] as shown in the table below: Notes: Western and southern Yemen: Taʽizzi, Adeni and Tihamiyya dialects (coastal Yemen), in addition to southwestern (Salalah region) and eastern Oman, including Muscat, the capital.

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ج.", "instruction": "Explain Significance", "response": "Hebrew spelling: גִּימֶל Bertrand Russell posits that the letter's form is a conventionalized image of a camel. The letter may be the shape of the walking animal's head, neck, and forelegs. Barry B. Powell, a specialist in the history of writing, states “It is hard to imagine how gimel = ‘camel’ can be derived from the picture of a camel (it may show his hump, or his head and neck!)”. Gimel is one of the six letters which can receive a dagesh qal. The two functions of dagesh are distinguished as either qal (light) or hazaq (strong). The six letters that can receive a dagesh qal are bet, gimel, daled, kaph, pe, and taf. Three of them (bet, kaph, and pe) have their sound value changed in modern Hebrew from the fricative to the plosive by adding a dagesh. The other three represent the same pronunciation in modern Hebrew, but have had alternate pronunciations at other times and places. They are essentially pronounced in the fricative as ג gh غ, dh ذ and th ث. In the Temani pronunciation, gimel represents /ɡ/, /ʒ/, or /d͡ʒ/ when with a dagesh, and /ɣ/ without a dagesh. In modern Hebrew, the combination ג׳‎ (gimel followed by a geresh) is used in loanwords and foreign names to denote [d͡ʒ]. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimel)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ج.", "instruction": "Explain Syriac gamal/gomal", "response": "In gematria, gimel represents the number three. It is written like a vav with a yud as a \"foot\", and is traditionally believed to resemble a person in motion; symbolically, a rich man running after a poor man to give him charity. In the Hebrew alphabet gimel directly precedes dalet, which signifies a poor or lowly man, given its similarity to the Hebrew word dal (b. Shabbat, 104a). Gimel is also one of the seven letters which receive special crowns (called tagin) when written in a Sefer Torah. See shin, ayin, teth, nun, zayin, and tsadi. The letter gimel is the electoral symbol for the United Torah Judaism party, and the party is often nicknamed Gimmel.
