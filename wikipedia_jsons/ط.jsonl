{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ط.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "Teth, also written as Ṭēth or Tet, is the ninth letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician ṭēt 𐤈, Hebrew, Aramaic ṭēṯ 𐡈, and Syriac ṭēṯ ܛ, and Arabic ṭāʾ ط‎. It is also related to the Ancient North Arabian 𐪗‎‎‎, South Arabian 𐩷, and Geʽez ጠ. The Phoenician letter also gave rise to the Greek theta (Θ), originally an aspirated voiceless dental stop but now used for the voiceless dental fricative. The Arabic letter (ط) is sometimes transliterated as Tah in English, for example in Arabic script in Unicode. The sound value of Teth is /tˤ/, one of the Semitic emphatic consonants. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teth)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ط.", "instruction": "Explain Arabic ṭāʾ", "response": "The Phoenician letter name ṭēth may mean \"spinning wheel\" pictured as (compare Hebrew root ט-ו-י‎ (ṭ-w-y) meaning 'spinning' (a thread) which begins with Teth). According to another hypothesis (Brian Colless), the letter possibly continues a Middle Bronze Age glyph named ṭab 'good', Aramaic טַב‎ 'tav', Hebrew טוב‎ 'tov', Syriac ܛܒܐ 'tava', modern Arabic طَيّب 'ṭayyib', all of identical meaning. Jewish religious books about the \"holy letters\" from the 10th century onward discuss the connection or origin of the letter Teth with the word tov \"good\". This was especially emphasized ever since the late 1600s after the Baal Shem Tov became influential, since the letter Teth was in his Acronym standing for Tov, and goodness was part of his philosophy. The acrostic poems of the Bible use 'Tov' to represent the letter (e.g. Psalm 119:65-72). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teth)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ط.", "instruction": "Explain Significance", "response": "In Modern Hebrew, Tet represents a voiceless alveolar plosive /t/, and is therefore usually homophonic with the abjad's final letter, Tav ת‎. However, Tet can be pharyngealized to produce [tˤ] in traditional Temani and Sephardi pronunciation. [tˤ] is also probably the pronunciation in Biblical Hebrew. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teth)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ط.", "instruction": "Explain Syriac tet", "response": "In gematria, Tet represents the number nine. When followed by an apostrophe, it means 9,000. The most common example of this usage is in the numbers of the Hebrew years (e.g., ט'תשנד‎ in numbers would be the date 9754). As well, in gematria, the number 15 is written with Tet and Vav, (9+6) to avoid the normal construction Yud and Hei (10+5) which spells a name of God. Similarly, 16 is written with Tet and Zayin (9+7) instead of Yud and Vav (10+6) to avoid spelling part of the Tetragrammaton. Tet is also one of the seven letters which receive special crowns (called tagin) when written in a Sefer Torah. See Shin, Ayin, Gimmel, Nun, Zayin, and Tzadi. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teth)"}
