{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Å.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "The letter Å (å in lower case) represents various (although often similar) sounds in several languages. It is a separate letter in Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, North Frisian, Low Saxon, Transylvanian Saxon, Walloon, Chamorro, Lule Sami, Pite Sami, Skolt Sami, Southern Sami, Ume Sami, Pamirian languages, and Greenlandic alphabets. Additionally, it is part of the alphabets used for some Alemannic and Austro-Bavarian dialects of German. Though Å is derived from A by adding an overring, it is typically considered a separate letter. It developed as a form of semi-ligature of an A with a smaller o above it to denote a rounding of the long /a/ in Old Danish. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Å.", "instruction": "Explain Use in names", "response": "Historically, Old Norse had a long vowel /aː/ (sometimes spelled ⟨á⟩). Medieval writing often used doubled letters for long vowels, writing the vowel as ⟨aa⟩. From around 1200, the vowel underwent rounding towards [ɔː] to such a degree that it started to show up in the written language by using ⟨o⟩. In manuscripts from 1300 to 1400, a word like blaa ('blue', modern spelling ⟨blå⟩) could also be spelled ⟨blao⟩ or ⟨blo(o)⟩, sometimes with an added line. In Old Swedish the use of the ligature Æ and of Ø (originally also a variant of the ligature Œ) that represented the sounds [æ] and [ø] respectively were gradually replaced by new letters. Instead of using ligatures, a minuscule (that is, lower-case) E was placed above the letters A and O to create new graphemes, which later evolved into the modern letters Ä and Ö, as the E was simplified into the two dots now referred to as an umlaut. Similarly, a minuscule O was placed on top of an A to create a new letter which was used in place of the digraph Aa. It was first used in print in the Gustav Vasa Bible published in 1541 and replaced Aa in the 16th century. In an attempt to modernize the orthography, linguists tried to introduce the Å to Danish and Norwegian writing in the 19th century. Most people felt no need for the new letter, as the letter group Aa had already been pronounced like Å for centuries in Denmark and Norway. Aa was usually treated as a single letter, spoken like the present Å when spelling out names or words. Orthography reforms making Å official were carried out in Norway in 1917 and in Denmark in 1948. According to Jørgen Nørby Jensen, senior consultant at Dansk Sprognævn, the cause for the change in Denmark was a combination of anti-German and pro-Nordic sentiment. Danish had been the only language apart from German and Luxembourgish to use capitalized nouns in the last decades, but abolished them at the same time. In a few names of Danish cities or towns, the old spelling has been retained as an option due to local resistance, e.g. Aalborg and Aabenraa; however, Ålborg and Åbenrå are the spellings recommended by the Danish Language Board. Between 1948 and 2010, the city of Aarhus was officially spelled Århus. However, the city has reverted to the Aa spelling starting 2011, in a controversial decision citing internationalization and web compatibility advantages. Icelandic and Faroese are the only North Germanic languages not to use the å. The Old Norse letter á is retained, but the sound it now expresses is a diphthong, pronounced [au] in Icelandic and [ɔa] in Faroese. The short variation of Faroese á is pronounced [ɔ], though. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Å.", "instruction": "Explain Alphabetization", "response": "In some place names, the old Aa spelling dominates, more often in Denmark than in Norway (where it has been abolished in official use since 1917). Locals of Aalborg and Aabenraa resist the Å, whereas Ålesund is rarely seen with Aa spelling. Official rules allow both forms in the most common cases, but Å is always correct. Å as a word means \"small river\" in Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian and can be found in place names. Before 1917, when spelling with the double A was common, some Norwegian place names contained three or four consecutive A letters: for instance Haaa (now Håa, a river) and Blaaaasen (Blååsen, 'the blue (\"blå\") ridge (\"ås\")'). In family names, the bearer of the name uses Aa or Å according to their choice, but since family names are inherited they are resistant to change and the traditional Aa style is often kept. For instance, the last name Aagaard is much more common than Ågård. The surname Aa is always spelled with double A, never with the single å. However, given names - which are less commonly inherited - have largely changed to the use of the Å. For instance, in Norway more than 12,000 male citizens spell their name Håkon, while only around 2,500 are named Haakon. Company names are sometimes spelled with the double A by choice, usually in order to convey an impression of old-fashionedness or traditionality. The double A, representing a single sound, is usually kept in initials e.g. for people whose first, middle, and/or last name begins with the double A. Accordingly, a man named \"Hans Aagard Hauge\" would spell his initials \"H. Aa. H.\" (not \"H. A. H.\" nor \"H. Å. H.\"), while a woman named Aase Vestergaard would spell her initials \"Aa. V.\" (not \"A. V.\" nor \"Å. V.\"). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85)"}

This is also true for the alternative spelling \"Aa\". Unless manually corrected, sorting algorithms of programs localized for Danish or Norwegian place e.g., Aaron after Zorro. In Danish the correct sorting of aa depends on pronunciation: If the sound is pronounced as one sound it is sorted as Å regardless of the sound is 'a' or 'å'; thus, for example, the German city Aachen is listed under Å, as well as the Danish city Aabenraa.

This is easiest to remember across the Nordic languages, that Danish and Norwegian follow Z first with E-mutated letters Æ and Ø and then the symbol with a one-stroke diacritic Å. Swedish and Finnish follow Z with a one-stroke diacritic Å and then a two-stroke (or two-dot) diacritic Ä, Ö.

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Å.", "instruction": "Explain Finnish", "response": "Alternative spellings of the Scandinavian Å have become a concern because of globalization, and particularly because of the popularization of the World Wide Web. This is to a large extent due to the fact that prior to the creation of IDNA system around 2005, internet domains containing Scandinavian letters were not recognized by the DNS, and anyway do not feature on keyboards adapted for other languages. While it is recommended to keep the Å intact wherever possible, the next best thing is to use the older, double A spelling (e.g. \"www.raade.com\" instead of \"www.råde.com\"). This is because, as previously discussed, the Å/Aa indicates a separate sound. If the Å is represented as a common A without the overring (e.g. \"www.rade.com\") there is no indication that the A is supposed to represent another sound entirely. Even so, representing the Å as just an A is particularly common in Sweden, as compared to Norway and Denmark, because the spelling Aa has no traditional use there. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Å.", "instruction": "Explain Emilian", "response": "Because the Finnish alphabet is derived from the Swedish alphabet, Å is carried over, but it has no native Finnish use and is treated as in Swedish. Its usage is limited to loanwords (the Finnish academic dictionary Kielitoimiston sanakirja, about 100,000 words, has only one word containing Å: ångström) and names of Swedish, Danish or Norwegian origin. In Finland there are many Swedish-speaking as well as many Finnish-speaking people with Swedish surnames, and many Swedish surnames include Å. In addition, there are many geographical places in the Finnish coastal areas and archipelago that have å in their Swedish names, such as Kråkö and Långnäs, as well as the Finnish autonomic region of Åland, a group of islands midst between Sweden and Finland where almost all natives speak Swedish. The Finnish name for Å is ruotsalainen oo (\"Swedish O\"), and is pronounced identically to O, which has the value [o̞]. (Note that in Swedish, the sounds [oː] and [ɔ] may be represented by Å or O, but O also represents [uː] and [ʊ].)

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Å.", "instruction": "Explain Istro-Romanian", "response": "The letter å was introduced to some eastern local variants of Walloon at the beginning of the 16th century and initially noted the same sound as in Danish. Its use then spread to all eastern dialects, under the cultural influence of Liege, and covered three sounds, a long open o, a long closed o, or a long a, depending on the local varieties. The use of a single å letter to cover such pronunciations has been embraced by the more recent pan-Walloon orthography (rifondou or Common Walloon), with one orthography for words regardless of the local phonetic variations. In non-standardized writings outside the Liege area, words containing å are written with au / ô (representing the same sound) or â. For example, the word måjhon (house) in the standardized orthography is spelled môjo(n), mâhon, maujon in dialectal writings (mohone is another form that does not contain a long å). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85)"}
