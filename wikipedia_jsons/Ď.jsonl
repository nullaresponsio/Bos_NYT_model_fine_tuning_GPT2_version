{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ď.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "The grapheme Ď (minuscule: ď) is a letter in the Czech and Slovak alphabets used to denote /ɟ/, the voiced palatal plosive (precisely alveolo-palatal), a sound similar to British English d in dew. It was also used in Polabian. The majuscule of the letter (Ď) is formed from Latin D with the addition of a háček; the minuscule of the letter (ď) has a háček modified to an apostrophe-like stroke instead of a wedge. When collating, Ď is placed right after regular D in the alphabet. Ď is also used to represent uppercase eth in the coat of arms of Shetland although the standard uppercase form of eth is Ð. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8E)"}
