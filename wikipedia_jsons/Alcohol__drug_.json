Alcohol is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant, decreasing electrical activity of neurons in the brain, which causes the characteristic effects of alcohol intoxication (\"drunkenness\"). Among other effects, alcohol produces euphoria, decreased anxiety, increased sociability, sedation, and impairment of cognitive, memory, motor, and sensory function. Alcohol has a variety of adverse effects. Short-term adverse effects include generalized impairment of neurocognitive function, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and symptoms of hangover. Alcohol is addictive and can result in alcohol use disorder, dependence, and withdrawal upon cessation. The long-term effects of alcohol are considered to be a major global public health issue and include liver disease, hepatitis, cardiovascular disease (e.g., cardiomyopathy), polyneuropathy, alcoholic hallucinosis, long-term impact on the brain (e.g., brain damage, dementia, and Marchiafavaâ€“Bignami disease), and cancers. The adverse effects of alcohol on health are most significant when it is used in excessive quantities or with heavy frequency. However, in 2023, the World Health Organization published a statement in The Lancet Public Health that concluded, \"no safe amount of alcohol consumption for cancers and health can be established.\" In high amounts, alcohol may cause loss of consciousness or, in severe cases, death. Alcohol has been produced and consumed by humans for its psychoactive effects since at least 13,000 years ago, when the earliest known beer was brewed by the Natufian culture in the Middle East. Alcohol is the second most consumed psychoactive drug globally, behind caffeine. Drinking alcohol is generally socially acceptable and is legal in most countries, unlike with many other recreational substances. However, there are often restrictions on alcohol sale and use, for instance a minimum age for drinking and laws against public drinking and drinking and driving. Alcohol has considerable societal and cultural significance and has important social roles in much of the world. Drinking establishments, such as bars and nightclubs, revolve primarily around the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages, and parties, festivals, and social gatherings commonly involve alcohol consumption. Alcohol is related to various societal problems, including drunk driving, accidental injuries, sexual assaults, domestic abuse, and violent crime. Alcohol remains illegal for sale and consumption in a number of countries, mainly in the Middle East. While some religions, including Islam, prohibit alcohol consumption, other religions, such as Christianity and Shinto, utilize alcohol in sacrament and libation.\n\nDiberal, also known as 5-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-5-ethylbarbituric acid or DMBB, is an atypical barbiturate. This compound can be either convulsant or anticonvulsant depending on which enantiomer is used.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)"
