{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ب.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "Bet, Beth, Beh, or Vet is the second letter of the Semitic abjads, including Phoenician bēt 𐤁 , Hebrew bēt ב‎, Aramaic bēṯ 𐡁, Syriac bēṯ ܒ and Arabic bāʾ ب‎. It is also related to the Ancient North Arabian 𐪈‎, South Arabian 𐩨, and Ge'ez በ. Its sound value is the voiced bilabial stop ⟨b⟩ or the voiced labiodental fricative ⟨v⟩. The letter's name means \"house\" in various Semitic languages (Arabic bayt, Akkadian bītu, bētu, Hebrew: bayīṯ, Phoenician bēt etc.; ultimately all from Proto-Semitic *bayt-), and appears to derive from an Egyptian hieroglyph of a house by acrophony. The Phoenician letter gave rise to, among others, the Greek beta (Β, β), Latin B (B, b) and Cyrillic Be (Б, б) and Ve (В, в), and also the Armenian letter Ben (Բ, բ). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bet_(letter))"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ب.", "instruction": "Explain Arabic bāʾ", "response": "The name bet is derived from the West Semitic word for \"house\" (as in Hebrew: בַּיִת, romanized: bayt), and the shape of the letter derives from a Proto-Sinaitic glyph that may have been based on the Egyptian hieroglyph Pr , which depicts a house. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bet_(letter))"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on ب.", "instruction": "Explain Variations on written form/pronunciation", "response": "Hebrew spelling: בֵּית‎ The Hebrew letter represents two different phonemes: a \"b\" sound (/b/) (bet) and a \"v\" sound (/v/) (vet). When Hebrew is written Ktiv menuqad (with niqqud diacritics) the two are distinguished by a dot (called a dagesh) in the centre of the letter for /b/ and no dot for /v/. In modern Hebrew, the more commonly used Ktiv hasar niqqud spelling, which does not use diacritics, does not visually distinguish between the two phonemes. This letter is named bet and vet, following the modern Israeli Hebrew pronunciation, bet and vet (/bet/), in Israel and by most Jews familiar with Hebrew, although some non-Israeli Ashkenazi speakers pronounce it beis (or bais) and veis (/bejs/) (or vais or vaiz). It is also named beth, following the Tiberian Hebrew pronunciation, in academic circles. In modern Hebrew the frequency of the usage of bet, out of all the letters, is 4.98%. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bet_(letter))"}

Bet in gematria represents the number 2. Bet is the first letter of the Torah. As Bet is the number 2 in gematria, this is said to symbolize that there are two parts to Torah: the Written Torah and the Oral Torah. According to Jewish legend, the letter Bet was specially chosen among the 22 letters in Hebrew by God as the first letter of Torah as it begins with \"Bereshit (In the beginning) God created heaven and earth.\" Genesis Rabbah points out that the letter is closed on three sides and open on one; this is indicate that one can investigate what happened after creation, but not what happened before it, or what is above the heavens or below the earth. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bet_(letter))"}

It is one of six letters that represents two associated sounds (the others are Gimel, Dalet, Kaph, Pe and Taw). When Beth has a hard pronunciation (qûššāyâ) it is a [b]. When Beth has a soft pronunciation (rûkkāḵâ) it is traditionally pronounced as a [v], similar to its Hebrew form. However, in eastern dialects, the soft Beth is more often pronounced as a [w], and can form diphthongs with its preceding vowel. Whether Beth should be pronounced as a hard or soft sound is generally determined by its context within a word. However, wherever it is traditionally geminate within a word, even in dialects that no longer distinguish double consonants, it is hard. In the West Syriac dialect, some speakers always pronounce Beth with its hard sound. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bet_(letter))"}
