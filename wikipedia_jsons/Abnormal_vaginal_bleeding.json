  "assistant": "Vaginal bleeding is any expulsion of blood from the vagina. This bleeding may originate from the uterus, vaginal wall, or cervix. Generally, it is either part of a normal menstrual cycle or is caused by hormonal or other problems of the reproductive system, such as abnormal uterine bleeding. Regular monthly vaginal bleeding during the reproductive years, menstruation, is a normal physiologic process. During the reproductive years, bleeding that is excessively heavy (menorrhagia or heavy menstrual bleeding), occurs between monthly menstrual periods (intermenstrual bleeding), occurs more frequently than every 21 days (abnormal uterine bleeding), occurs too infrequently (oligomenorrhea), or occurs after vaginal intercourse (postcoital bleeding) should be evaluated. The causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding vary by age, and such bleeding can be a sign of specific medical conditions ranging from hormone imbalances or anovulation to malignancy (cervical cancer, vaginal cancer or uterine cancer). In young children, or elderly adults with cognitive impairment, the source of bleeding may not be obvious, and may be from the urinary tract (hematuria) or the rectum rather than the vagina, although most adult women can identify the site of bleeding. When vaginal bleeding occurs in prepubertal children or in postmenopausal women, it always needs medical attention. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can be normal, especially in early pregnancy. However, bleeding may also indicate a pregnancy complication that needs to be medically addressed. During pregnancy bleeding is usually, but not always, related to the pregnancy itself. The treatment of vaginal bleeding is dependent on the specific cause, which can often be determined through a thorough history, physical, and medical testing.\n\nAbnormal uterine bleeding is vaginal bleeding from the uterus that is abnormally frequent, lasts excessively long, is heavier than normal, or is irregular. The term \"dysfunctional uterine bleeding\" was used when no underlying cause was present. Quality of life may be negatively affected. The underlying causes may be structural or non-structural and are classified in accordance with the FIGO system 1 & 2. Common causes include: Ovulation problems, fibroids, the lining of the uterus growing into the uterine wall, uterine polyps, underlying bleeding problems, side effects from birth control, or cancer. Susceptibility to each cause is often dependent on an individual's stage in life (prepubescent, premenopausal, postmenopausal). More than one category of causes may apply in an individual case. The first step in work-up is to rule out a tumor or pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy may be abnormal in certain circumstances. Please see Obstetrical bleeding and early pregnancy bleeding for more information.Medical imaging or hysteroscopy may help with the diagnosis. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Options may include hormonal birth control, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, tranexamic acid, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and surgery such as endometrial ablation or hysterectomy. Over the course of a year, roughly 20% of reproductive-aged women self-report at least one symptom of abnormal uterine bleeding.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaginal_bleeding"
