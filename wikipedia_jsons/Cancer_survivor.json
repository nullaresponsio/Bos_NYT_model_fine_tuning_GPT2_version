  "assistant": "A cancer survivor is a person with cancer of any type who is still living. Whether a person becomes a survivor at the time of diagnosis or after completing treatment, whether people who are actively dying are considered survivors, and whether healthy friends and family members of the cancer patient are also considered survivors, varies from group to group. Some people who have been diagnosed with cancer reject the term survivor or disagree with some definitions of it. How many people are cancer survivors depends on the definition used. Nearly 65% of adults diagnosed with cancer in the developed world are expected to live at least five years after the cancer is discovered. In the U.S. for example, about 17 million Americans alive today—one in 20 people–are either currently undergoing treatment for cancer or have done so in the past (up from 11 million, or one in thirty people, in 2009). Globally, about 45 million people, mostly from wealthier countries, have survived cancer for at least five years. For many people, surviving cancer can be highly traumatic and it is not uncommon for people to experience psychological distress such as post-traumatic stress-disorder or symptoms of post-traumatic-stress. Some cancer survivors describe the process of living with and beating cancer as a life-changing experience and some people who survive cancer may use the experience as opportunities for creative self-transformation into a \"better person\" or as motivation to meet goals of great personal importance, such as climbing a mountain or reconciling with an estranged family member. This process of post-traumatic growth is called benefit finding. Cancer survivors often have specific medical and non-medical needs related to their cancer experience.\n\nAdaptive behavior is behavior that enables a person (usually used in the context of children) to cope in their environment with greatest success and least conflict with others. This is a term used in the areas of psychology and special education. Adaptive behavior relates to everyday skills or tasks that the \"average\" person is able to complete, similar to the term life skills. Nonconstructive or disruptive social or personal behaviors can sometimes be used to achieve a constructive outcome. For example, a constant repetitive action could be re-focused on something that creates or builds something. In other words, the behavior can be adapted to something else. In contrast, maladaptive behavior is a type of behavior that is often used to reduce one's anxiety, but the result is dysfunctional and non-productive coping. For example, avoiding situations because you have unrealistic fears may initially reduce your anxiety, but it is non-productive in alleviating the actual problem in the long term. Maladaptive behavior is frequently used as an indicator of abnormality or mental dysfunction, since its assessment is relatively free from subjectivity. However, many behaviors considered moral can be maladaptive, such as dissent or abstinence. Adaptive behavior reflects an individual's social and practical competence to meet the demands of everyday living. Behavioral patterns change throughout a person's development, life settings and social constructs, evolution of personal values, and the expectations of others. It is important to assess adaptive behavior in order to determine how well an individual functions in daily life: vocationally, socially and educationally.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_survivor"
