{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on √Ü.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "√Ü (lowercase: √¶) is a character formed from the letters a and e, originally a ligature representing the Latin diphthong ae. It has been promoted to the status of a letter in some languages, including Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and Faroese. It was also used in Old Swedish before being changed to √§. The modern International Phonetic Alphabet uses it to represent the near-open front unrounded vowel (the sound represented by the 'a' in English words like cat). Diacritic variants include «¢/«£, «º/«Ω, √ÜÃÄ/√¶ÃÄ, √ÜÃÇ/√¶ÃÇ and √ÜÃÉ/√¶ÃÉ. As a letter of the Old English Latin alphabet, it was called √¶sc, \"ash tree\", after the Anglo-Saxon futhorc rune ·ö´ which it transliterated; its traditional name in English is still ash, or √¶sh (Old English: √¶sƒã) if the ligature is included. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on √Ü.", "instruction": "Explain French", "response": "In English, use of the ligature varies between different places and contexts, but it is fairly rare. In modern typography, if technological limitations make the use of √¶ difficult (such as in use of typewriters, telegraphs, or ASCII), the digraph ae is often used instead. In Old English, √¶ represented a sound between a and e (/√¶/), very much like the short a of cat in many dialects of Modern English. If long vowels are distinguished from short vowels, the long version /√¶Àê/ is marked with a macron («£) or, less commonly, an acute («Ω). In the United States, the issue of the ligature is sidestepped in many cases by use of a simplified spelling with \"e\", as happened with ≈ì as well; thus, archeology is more commonly used than archaeology in American English. Usage of the ae diphthong, however, may vary. For example, medieval is now more common than mediaeval (and the now old-fashioned medi√¶val), even in the United Kingdom. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on √Ü.", "instruction": "Explain Latin", "response": "In the modern French alphabet, √¶ (called e-dans-l'a, 'e in the a') is used to spell Latin and Greek borrowings like curriculum vit√¶, et c√¶tera, ex √¶quo, t√¶nia, and the first name L√¶titia. It is mentioned in the name of Serge Gainsbourg's song Elaeudanla T√©√Øt√©√Øa, a reading of the French spelling of the name L√¶titia: \"L, A, E dans l'A, T, I, T, I, A.\" <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on √Ü.", "instruction": "Explain Other Germanic languages", "response": "In Classical Latin, the combination AE denotes the diphthong [aj], which had a value similar to the long i in fine as pronounced in most dialects of Modern English. Both classical and present practice is to write the letters separately, but the ligature was used in medieval and early modern writings, in part because √¶ was reduced to the simple vowel […õ] during the Roman Empire. In some medieval scripts, the ligature was simplified to ƒô, an e with ogonek, called the e caudata (Latin for \"tailed e\"). That was further simplified into a plain e, which may have influenced or been influenced by the pronunciation change. However, the ligature is still relatively common in liturgical books and musical scores. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on √Ü.", "instruction": "Explain Ossetian", "response": "Old Norse In Old Norse, √¶ represents the long vowel /…õÀê/. The short version of the same vowel, /…õ/, if it is distinguished from /e/, is written as ƒô. Icelandic In Icelandic, √¶ represents the diphthong [ai], which can be long or short. Faroese In most varieties of Faroese, √¶ is pronounced as follows: […õa] when simultaneously stressed and occurring either word-finally, before a vowel letter, before a single consonant letter, or before the consonant-letter groups kl, kr, pl, pr, tr, kj, tj, sj, and those consisting of √∞ and one other consonant letter, except for √∞r when pronounced like gr (except as below) a rather open [eÀê] when directly followed by the sound [a], as in r√¶√∞ast (silent √∞) and fr√¶gari (silent g) [a] in all other cases One of its etymological origins is Old Norse √© (the other is Old Norse √¶), which is particularly evident in the dialects of Su√∞uroy, where √Ü is [eÀê] or […õ]: √¶√∞a (eider): Southern [eÀêa], Northern Faroese […õava] √¶tt (family, direction): Southern […õtÀê], Northern Faroese [atÀê] German and Swedish The equivalent letter in German and Swedish is √§, but it is not located at the same place within the alphabet. In German, it is not a separate letter from \"A\" but in Swedish, it is the second-to-last letter (between √• and √∂). In the normalized spelling of Middle High German, √¶ represents a long vowel […õÀê]. The actual spelling in the manuscripts varies, however. Danish and Norwegian In Danish and Norwegian, √¶ is a separate letter of the alphabet that represents a monophthong. It follows z and precedes √∏ and √•. In Norwegian, there are four ways of pronouncing the letter: /√¶Àê/ as in √¶ (the name of the letter), b√¶r, Solskj√¶r, l√¶ring, √¶ra, √Ünes, √¶rlig, t√¶rne, Kv√¶rner, D√¶hlie, s√¶rs, √¶rfugl, l√¶rt, tr√¶r (\"trees\") /√¶/ as in f√¶rre, √¶sj, n√¶rmere, F√¶rder, Skj√¶rv√∏, √¶rverdig, v√¶rt, l√¶rd, Br√¶in (where √¶i is pronounced as a diphthong /√¶i/) /eÀê/ as in S√¶ther, N√¶ser, S√¶b√∏, g√¶lisk, sp√¶lsau, bev√¶pne, s√¶d, √¶ser, C√¶sar, v√¶te, tr√¶r (\"thread(s)\" [verb]) /e/ as in S√¶th, N√¶ss, Br√¶nne, B√¶kkelund, Volleb√¶k, v√¶ske, tr√¶dd In many northern, western, and southwestern Norwegian dialects such as Tr√∏ndersk and in the western Danish dialects of Thy and Southern Jutland, the word \"I\" (Standard Danish: jeg, Bokm√•l Norwegian: jeg, Nynorsk Norwegian: eg) is pronounced /√¶Àê/. Thus, when this word is written as it is pronounced in these dialects (rather than the standard), it is often spelled with the letter \"√¶\". In western and southern Jutish dialects of Danish, √¶ is also the proclitic definite article: √¶ hus (the house), as opposed to Standard Danish and all other Nordic varieties which have enclitic definite articles (Danish, Swedish, Norwegian: huset; Icelandic, Faroese: h√∫si√∞ [the house]). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86)"}
