  "assistant": "An altered state of consciousness (ASC), also called an altered state of mind, altered mental status (AMS) or mind alteration, is any condition which is significantly different from a normal waking state. It describes induced changes in one's mental state, almost always temporary. A synonymous phrase is \"altered state of awareness\".\n\nThe 5-HT2A receptor is a subtype of the 5-HT2 receptor that belongs to the serotonin receptor family and functions as a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). It is a cell surface receptor that activates multiple intracellular signalling cascades. Like all 5-HT2 receptors, the 5-HT2A receptor is coupled to the Gq/G11 signaling pathway. It is the primary excitatory receptor subtype among the serotonin-responsive GPCRs. The 5-HT2A receptor was initially noted for its central role as the primary target of serotonergic psychedelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin mushrooms. It later regained research prominence when found to mediate, at least in part, the effects of many antipsychotic drugs, particularly atypical antipsychotics. Downregulation of post-synaptic 5-HT2A receptors is an adaptive response triggered by chronic administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and atypical antipsychotics. Elevated 5-HT2A receptor density has been observed in suicidal and otherwise depressed patients, suggesting that post-synaptic 5-HT2A receptor overexpression may contribute to the pathogenesis of depression. Paradoxically, several 5-HT2A receptor antagonists can also induce receptor downregulation. This effect may lead to reverse tolerance, rather than the expected development of tolerance. However, at least one antagonist has been shown to upregulate 5-HT2A receptor expression, and a few others appear to have no effect on receptor levels. Nonetheless, such upregulation remains the exception rather than the rule. Importantly, neither tolerance nor rebound has been observed in humans in relation to the slow-wave sleep (SWS)-promoting effects of 5-HT2A antagonists.\n\n<WIKIPEDIA_LINK> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altered_state_of_consciousness"
