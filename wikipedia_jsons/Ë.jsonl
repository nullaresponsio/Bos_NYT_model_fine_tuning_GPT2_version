{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ë.", "instruction": "Explain Overview", "response": "Ë, ë (e-diaeresis) is a letter in the Albanian, Kashubian, Emilian, Romagnol, Ladin, and Lenape alphabets. As a variant of the letter e, it also appears in Acehnese, Afrikaans, Belarusian, Breton, Dutch, English, Filipino, French, Luxembourgish, Piedmontese, Russian, the Abruzzese dialect of the Neapolitan language, and the Ascolano dialect. The letter is also used in Seneca, Taiwanese Hokkien, Turoyo, and Uyghur when written in Latin script. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8B)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ë.", "instruction": "Explain Albanian", "response": "In Afrikaans, the diaeresis (Afrikaans: deelteken, [ˈdiəl.tiəkən]) is used mostly to indicate that two vowels are pronounced separately. The deelteken does exactly what it means in Afrikaans (\"separation mark\") by marking the beginning of a new syllable and by separating it from the previous one. For example, geëet (\"eaten\") is pronounced [χəˈiət] in two syllables, the second one beginning with ë. The deelteken does not always influence the number of syllables. The word voël (\"bird\"), pronounced [fuəl], is different from voel (\"feel\"), pronounced [ful], but both words have one syllable. In other cases, the deelteken does not even change the pronunciation. The words geër (\"giver\") and geer (a wedge-shaped piece of fabric), for instance, are both pronounced [χiər] in contemporary language. Historically, though, words like geër or reën (\"rain\") were pronounced in two syllables: reën, which nowadays is pronounced [riən], was pronounced as [ˈreː.ən] in older Afrikaans. The deelteken is only etymological since the archaic form of reën is regen. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8B)"}
{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ë.", "instruction": "Explain Armenian", "response": "Ë is the 8th letter of the Albanian alphabet and represents the vowel /ə/, like the pronunciation of the ⟨a⟩ in \"ago\".

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ë.", "instruction": "Explain Dutch", "response": "Ë is a phonetic symbol also used in the transcription of Abruzzese dialects and in the Province of Ascoli Piceno (the Ascolano dialect).

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ë.", "instruction": "Explain Emilian", "response": "In Dutch, ë appears in the plural form of most words that end in -ie or -ee, like kolonie -> koloniën, zee -> zeeën, and knie -> knieën (Dutch-language rules stipulate an extra e before the ë in plurals if the accent falls on the syllable containing the ë). This so-called trema indicates that the vowel letter does not form a digraph with the preceding vowel letter but is pronounced separately. For example, koloniën is pronounced [koːˈloːnijə(n)] , but kolonien would be pronounced *[koːˈloːnin]. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8B)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ë.", "instruction": "Explain Filipino", "response": "Use of the character Ë in the English language is relatively rare. Some publications, such as the American magazine The New Yorker, use it more often than others.

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ë.", "instruction": "Explain French", "response": "In the Filipino language (Filipíno/Filipino), Ë or ë, only since 2013, represents the schwa vowel sound natively existing in few to some Filipino words from Maranao (Mëranáw/Mëranaw), Pangasinan (Panggasinán/Pangasinan), and Ilocano (Ilokáno/Ilokano) languages that are also words in Filipino. Such is the case among few to some other Filipino words from other languages in the Philippines that natively have this vowel sound (e.g. Karay-a (Karáy-a/Kinaray-a), Cuyonon (Kuyónon/Kuyonon), Kankanaey (Kankanáëy/Kankanay), and Ibaloi (Ibalóy/Ibaloy) languages) and that are also words in Filipino. Before the introduction of this variant of the letter Ee in the Filipino language's orthography, the schwa vowel sound was ambiguously represented by either the letter A / a or E / e. Since stressed vowels are marked with an acute accent (Éé), the Ë / ë, when stressed, will become Ë́ / ë́. <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8B)"}

{"system": "You are a helpful assistant on Ë.", "instruction": "Explain Mayan languages", "response": "In Luxembourgish, ë is used to indicate stressed schwa /ə/ as in the word ëmmer [ˈəmɐ] (\"always\"). Otherwise, a stressed e is pronounced as [æ] (e.g. sechs [zæks] (\"six\")), [ɛ] (e.g. Verb [vɛχp] (\"verb\")) or [eː] (e.g. Prefix [ˈpʀeːfiks] (\"prefix\")). It is also used to indicate an unstressed schwa in the following cases: Before or after a double ee, pronounced [eː], to indicate that the ë does not form a digraph with the preceding or following vowel letter but is pronounced separately, for example: gëeegent [ɡəˈʔeːʑənt] (\"suitable\"), Eeër [ˈeːɐ] (\"eggs\") or leeën [ˈleːən] (\"to lay\"). This also applies to French loanwords ending in -ée, e.g. Musée [ˈmyːzeː] (\"museum\"), n-plural: Muséeën [ˈmyːzeːən], n-less plural: Muséeë [ˈmyːzeːə]. About usage of plural forms with and without -n, see Eifeler Regel. To indicate that the word-final -e is pronounced in the n-less plural form of words whose singular ends in a mute -e, e.g. Orange [ˈoʀɑ̃ːʃ] (\"orange\", singular), Orangen [ˈoʀɑ̃ːʃən] (plural with -n), Orangë [ˈoʀɑ̃ːʃə] (plural without -n). In feminine nouns with a word-final mute -e denoting a female person, an extra ë is added in the plural to distinguish it from the plural of the corresponding masculine noun: Cliente [ˈkliɑ̃ːt] (\"customer\" [female], feminine, singular), Clienteën [ˈkliɑ̃ːtən] (plural with -n), Clienteë [ˈkliɑ̃ːtə] (plural without -n) vs. Client [ˈkliɑ̃ː] (\"customer\" [male or gender-neutral], masculine, singular), Clienten [ˈkliɑ̃ːən] (plural with -n), Clientë [ˈkliɑ̃ːə] (plural without -n). In the corresponding masculine nouns the diaeresis is used in the n-less plural form to distinguish it from the singular of the corresponding feminine noun: Clientë [ˈkliɑ̃ːə] (\"customers\" [male or gender-neutral], masculine, plural without -n) vs. Cliente [ˈkliɑ̃ːt] (\"customer\" [female], feminine, singular). <LINK>(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%8B)"}
